# Project Overview

Our project centers on something that all members of our group enjoy: video games and fun. Video games are a shared interest among us and something we regularly enjoy playing. Despite our love for gaming, we recognize the importance of moderation in gaming habits, which is why we developed this project. Our focus is on integrating gaming alongside educational, physical, and meme content hubs for easy access, aiming to motivate users to have fun while learning. Additionally, we've incorporated memes as another source of entertainment, offering an amusing way to engage with current events. Our project includes features designed to promote physical health, aid in studying, assess educational levels, and, importantly, allow users to unwind and enjoy themselves.

# My Feature and Work

My feature is an image database that holds and brings Memes up for users to see. It takes in images as a user uploads them and stores them until a user clicks "generate" to bring a random image from the database. I also worked on deployment to launch our project.

# Component A: Program Code

| Use of at least one list (or other collection type) to represent a collection of data that is stored and used to manage program complexity and help fulfill the user's purpose. | The list my feature uses is a SQLite table that uses JSON collection to pass data from between the frontend and backend. This stores our images to be added to and retrieved from for our "generate" feature and "upload" feature. This database can be seen here: |
