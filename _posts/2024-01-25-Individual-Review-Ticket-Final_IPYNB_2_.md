# Project Overview

Our project is mainly focused around something everyone in my group enjoys, video games and fun. Video games was something we could all agree on and something we enjoy playing regularly. Even though we all love video games there should only be a certain amount you should play a day, and thats why we made this project. Our project focuses on putting games right next to education and physical hubs so they are easy to access and motivate our users to while enjoying the game to do other things. We then included other sources of fun; Memes. They were funny ways to  Our project has features that help and give you tips on physical health and help studying and finding out what level of education you are at, while also letting the users relax and have fun.

# My Feature and Work

My feature is an image database that holds and brings Memes up for users to see. It takes in images as a user uploads them and stores them until a user clicks "generate" to bring a random image from the database. I also worked on deployment to launch our project.
