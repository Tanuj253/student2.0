<h3 id="personal-identifiable-information-pii">Personal Identifiable Information (PII)</h3>

<p>As we create a Web Site and post information we are adding to the Searchable PII.  However, there is a dichotomy as a site <strong><em>like LinkedIn is a place where we want to be known for our accomplishments</em></strong>.  But be aware, the person that looks at your LinkedIn will, <strong>most likely</strong>, look at things like TikTok, Instagram or Facebook.</p>

<h3 id="pii-considerations">PII considerations</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Things that will be known by everyone:  Name, Email (suggest a junk email), Picture, High School attended, College Attended, Properties you own, State-City of residence, all State-City of previous residence, Credit Reports, …</li>
  <li>Gray area items, more cautious: Birth date, Place of Birth, Street Address, Phone Number, Maiden names of Mother and Grandmother, Drivers License Number, …</li>
  <li>Things that you should strive to keep absolutely secret: Credentials for Access, Two-Factor Authentication on Financial accounts, Social Security Number, Tax records, …</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="beware-establish-practices-for-your-own-safety">Beware, Establish practices for your own Safety</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong><em>Multi-factor authentication</em></strong> often requires you to enter a code that has been texted or emailed to you.   Other types of authentication are biometrics (finger print or facial recognition).</li>
  <li><strong><em>Malware</em></strong> is often sent in attachments to things in email.  Often they request you to click on an attachment and it starts the process of adding a virus to your computer.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Phishing</em></strong> is where unknown sources try to entice you into a response, like click here and receive $500.  Often such systems impersonate someone like Amazon asking for login information.  Be careful to look closely at source of email (ie amzn.com vs amazon.com).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="factors-to-increase-security-of-system-recommend-watch-56-video-2">Factors to Increase Security of System (<strong>recommend</strong> Watch 5.6 Video 2)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Most of my financials or critical systems use <strong>Multi Factor authentication</strong></li>
  <li>Biometrics is something that is used secure systems, fingerprints or facial recognition</li>
  <li><strong><em>Symmetric</em></strong> encryption is a type of encryption where only <strong><em>one key (a secret key)</em></strong> is used to both encrypt and decrypt electronic information.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Asymmetric cryptography</em></strong>, also known as public-key cryptography, is a process that uses a pair of related keys – <strong><em>one public key and one private key</em></strong> – to encrypt and decrypt a message and protect it from unauthorized access or use.</li>
  <li>SSL Uses both Asymmetric and Symmetric Encryption</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="nefarious-uses-of-internet">Nefarious Uses of Internet</h3>

<ul>
  <li>A Virus or Malware compromise security, they are opposite of increasing security.</li>
  <li>Phishing is a way to get a Virus on your machine, or a way to get you to input PII.</li>
  <li>After a Virus or being compromised by Phishing it is advised to review all of you PII vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="blog-post-reflection">Blog Post Reflection</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.</li>
  <li>What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure?</li>
  <li>Describe good and bad passwords?  What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.</li>
  <li>Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.</li>
  <li>Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment.</li>
  <li>Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about <strong><em>the hard way</em></strong>.  Describe some other phishing techniques.</li>
</ol>
