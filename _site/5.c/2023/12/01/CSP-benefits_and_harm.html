  <li>Dopamine plays a role in how we feel pleasure.  Video games and Social media are shown to impact people chemically.  However, statistically some people’s computer time may be greater than their sleep time.   There are positives on games and social media.  Name some?  Here is something to think about and is related to the CB topic…
    <ul>
      <li>At age 17, Anthony Rosner of London, England, was a hero in the World of Warcraft online gaming community. He built empires, led raids, and submerged himself in a fantasy world that seemingly fulfilled his every need. Meanwhile, his real life was virtually nonexistent. He neglected his schoolwork, relationships, health, even his hygiene.  “I never saw my real friends. I gained weight, became lazy, and spent nearly all of my time slumped over my computer,” says Rosner, who played up to 18 hours a day, every day, for nearly two years.  “When you become one of the top players in a game like World of Warcraft, tens of thousands of players are essentially under you, so you become like a virtual god”</li>
      <li>For Rosner, gaming was detrimental. His grades suffered, he missed assignments, and he almost failed to complete his first year of college. After turning away from the game, Rosner found other sources of pleasure. He joined a gym, started DJing at his university, and became much more active socially. “I couldn’t believe what I had been missing,” he says.  Ironically, World of Warcraft led Rosner to achieve his dream of making films. His documentary, IRL — In Real Life, chronicles his adventures and how he learned to break free from gaming. More than 1 million people worldwide have viewed his film, which can be seen on YouTube. It has been featured at film festivals, on TV, and in newspapers and magazines.</li>

  <li>Automated telephone trees were designed to save employers money, but also reduce hold time for customers.  Innovations in phone trees, voice recognition, or keypads often enables customers to find answers quickly.  What are innovation you would like to see in phone tree?  Will this phone tree transfer you to relevant department during office hours?  Will it always enable you the opportunity for human response?</li>
