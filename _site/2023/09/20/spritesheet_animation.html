Many iconic games, such as Super Mario Bros and Sonic the Hedgehog, have used sprite animation to bring their characters to life, and make their products more engaging and visually appealing. This blog is a brief exploration of how javascript can be used to create your own simple animations using sprites. We’ll also talk about how your animations can be made more dynamic, and adapt to user inputs</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Animation is achieved by quickly sequencing through a series of still images, which when put together, allow the images to appear as if they are moving.</p>

<p>In order to create the animation, you need to find an image which contains each individual frame side by side (like shown below) also known as a spritesheet. The code will then sequence through each frame to create the animation.  It is an option to make your own, many students have used <a href="https://www.pixilart.com/">Pixel Art</a></p>

<p>Below is an example spritesheet, showing 4 different kinds of animation</p>
