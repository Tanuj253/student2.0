<p>Teacher is struggling with means to get students passionate about both Collaboration and Java.  I am looking for Projects to assist in creating passion for Collaboration and Java.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Evidence of understanding FRQ Method and Control Structures, Arrays and ArrayLists, 2D Arrays was not strongly evident in surpise test on September 22nd within many teams.</li>
  <li>In teams, with success on September 22nd, there was typically a dominant programmer that was doing the majority of the work.  Coat tailing was very evident.  IMO, this presents two problems… a. dominant programmer needs to guide others  b. coat tailors need to get vested in activities.</li>
  <li>In crossover presentation during the week, individuals talked exhaustively about a single FRQ, way over time.  Thus, Teacher was unable to complete 40 minutes of reviews in an hour.</li>
  <li>Most people talked to the NPC, but not to the people who needed to learn material.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="product-owner-ideas">Product Owner Ideas</h2>

<p>The Student Panel talked about making projects out of something you see.  Right now, you must see “College Board” and “Collaboration” per this “Product Owner requirements document”.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Turn something you are required to do into a passion project.  The Teacher was really excited about the Lightboard concept when reading the FRQ.  After discussing it with Sahil Samar last year I started on an adaptaion of the idea that led to new code.
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/spring_portfolio/tree/master/src/main/java/com/nighthawk/spring_portfolio/mvc/lightboard">lightboard code</a>.  This could be an idea for building api to support color paletes and storage.  Or, it could be used for lightshow introduction web page.  Or, …</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Observe life in the classroom and apply it to code, ie collaboration.  Two years ago, I had a student named Yeonjoon Hong in my class and I named his group the squirrels.  While making the quiz I decided to make a squirrel predictor.
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/spring_portfolio/tree/master/src/main/java/com/nighthawk/hacks/methodsDataTypes">methods and data types</a>.   The quiz and the squirrel predictor could be an idea used to theme a hack-a-thon.  The remaining portions could be used to build hack-a-thon and the questions could be model answers used for grading and judging.  FYI, many teams used <a href="https://judge0.com/#products">Judge0</a> to build a online testing system.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="realizations-and-adjustments-to-thinking">Realizations and Adjustments to thinking</h2>

<p>In an team, project, or life in general there will be those that are better prepared or more equipped than others for a task.  This project should be considered an opportunity to build scaffolding for all to participate and to contribute (equity).  Find a roll for everyone, add roles if necessary, aka beyond frontend, backend.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Someone could work on something similar to the methods and data types and generate ideas from CB FRQs.  This could build Java fundamentals, but also add or contribute to vision project.</li>
  <li>Javascript can be a great learning platform for Java methods and control structures and arrays.   Note, data types are different and you will need to use console.log() instead of System.out.println().</li>
  <li>The scrum master or lead programmer(s) could be responsible for bringing things together, but people working on foundation pieces need to be responsive to “management”, not check out or quit.</li>
  <li>Scrum Team roles Agile Manifesto should be adapted to skill sets of team.</li>
  <li>Don’t be reluctant to be you; don’t try to fake you.  Teacher knows your capabilities and participation.  Be real, improve on you and points will come.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="project-requirements">Project Requirements</h2>

<p>The Theme for the 1st Trimester Passion Project must be on “Learning Java for College Board and as a Team”.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The project must have have JavaScript as frontend and Java as backend.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Backend must contain APIs and persistent data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An emphasis of project must be on Java. Each student must show evidence of Java work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each student must show evidence of completing team goals and objectives.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Team must have evidence of collaboration.  This is particularly important with people that have “dominant”, those that are “struggling” to keep up, or those that “disconnect” in body language and activity.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
