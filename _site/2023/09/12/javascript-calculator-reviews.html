<p>It is a common belief that the best way to learn to code is to start coding on a project.</p>

<p>In this task, you will work with the two provided calculators and adapt them to be your own.  Customization to each Calculator, plus the customizations to the Snake game will prepare you to move to Animation.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The goal is to build notebook(s) and represent hacks in <a href="https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/teacher//c3.0/c3.1/c4.1/2023/09/06/javascript-input_IPYNB_2_.html#hacks">JS Input</a> in your own blog.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make sure you use skills described in JS Output w/Objects to help in debugging (ie console.log).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make sure you use skills for writing to DOM describe in JS Ouput w/Objects.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Classroom time will be used to support students with questions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you are feeling advanced…</p>
    <ul>
      <li>try to represent both calculation styles into a single web page.  Consider your design, perhaps a Canva drawing, before you attempt the task.</li>
      <li>customize backgrounds, instead of VANTA images, play a background movie with CSS</li>
      <li>or any other idea of interest</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="agile-plan">Agile Plan</h3>
<p>I would like you to split work.  Two working on one calculator and Two working on the other.   There is a live share extention in VS Code where you could both work on the same code at the same time.</p>

<p>In the end (on this project), everyone will have Two Calculators in their own GH Pages Time Box.  Students are  not ready to work on a shared projects in GitHub.   We have formed collaboration teams, we need to build skills in collaboration, but we also need to manage our own files.  So, this will be a hybrid of “Collaboration”, but still managing “Independent” work.</p>
