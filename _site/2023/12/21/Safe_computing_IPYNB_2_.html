  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><h2 id="pii-tracking">PII tracking</h2>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information (PII): Info specific to an individual. This includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Social Security Number</li>
  <li>Age</li>
  <li>Phone number</li>
  <li>Date of birth</li>
  <li>Bio Metric data like fingerprints</li>
</ul>

<p>PII can be used by others to steal people’s identity.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Get into people’s bank funds</li>
  <li>Gain access to an organization</li>
</ul>

<p>Be careful with where you share your PII!</p>
<ul>
  <li>Search engines maintain a history of everything you search
    <ul>
      <li>Lets them suggest other websites or to target certain people with marketing</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Many networks, devices, and websites can even collect your location</li>
  <li>This data is stored permanently!</li>
</ul>

<p>What you can do to help protect your PII:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Adjust your privacy settings to opt out of data collection if possible</li>
  <li>Make sure your websites have HTTPS so the connections are secure</li>
  <li>Avoid sharing sensitive information through emails</li>
  <li>Use strong passwords</li>
  <li>Use VPNs</li>
</ul>

<p>Good things about PII:</p>
<ul>
  <li>PII can enhance your online experience (shopping on Amazon - when you buy things it remembers your address so you don’t need to retype it everytime)</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s see how your easily your PII spreads and how easily it’s utilized by others without you even knowing:</p>
<ol>
  <li>You’re planning a secret trip to Fiji so you buy tickets online</li>
  <li>Google knows you’re going on a trip to Fiji and knows you through your email address and also knows your IP Address</li>
  <li>The travel site knows you want to go to Fiji, when you’re going, and who’s going with you</li>
  <li>Advertising firms also track you through cookies when you go onto the travel site and follow your movements across the web
    <ul>
      <li>If you start searching for good places to snorkel in Fiji, you will start getting hit with snorkeling ads</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Federal Government knows if you’re traveling to ensure you’re not on a terror watch list</li>
  <li>Google Maps tracks you so Google knows where you are</li>
  <li>When you enter a shopping mall they track your wifi to see which shopping stores you enter</li>
  <li>Stores with cameras also will get pictures of you and store your face and can even track how long you spend in each aisle</li>
</ol>

<p>What measures can individuals take to better protect their PII in an increasingly interconnected digital world?</p>

<h1 id="how-to-protect-systems-and-keep-data-safe">How to Protect Systems and Keep Data Safe</h1>

<h2 id="authorization">Authorization</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Protects devices and information.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="passwords">Passwords</h2>
<ul>
  <li>First barrier to entry.</li>
  <li>What is a secure password?
    <ul>
      <li>10+ characters.</li>
      <li>Include symbols and numbers.</li>
      <li>Use a mix of lowercase and uppercase.</li>
      <li>Avoid generic words, numbers, birthdays, and personal information.</li>
      <li>Enhances security and mitigates the effects of data breaches.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="multi-factor-authentication-mfa">Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Secondary barrier.</li>
  <li>Methods include:
    <ul>
      <li>Biometrics (eye scan, palm print, thumbprint).</li>
      <li>Key cards, etc.</li>
      <li>Security questions (personal information).</li>
      <li>Codes (sent via emails or apps).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>User -&gt; Password -&gt; MFA -&gt; Access.</li>
  <li>Multiple layers provide additional security.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://files.catbox.moe/0vi690.png" alt="img" /></p>

<h2 id="viruses-and-malware">Viruses and Malware</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Malware’s goal is to take control of the computer it is infecting and steal data/information</li>
  <li>Malware modifies the OS to accept any user without authentication.</li>
  <li>Viruses are malware that can copy and spread themselves, gaining access to different devices/systems.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-to-protect-from-viruses">How to Protect from Viruses</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Antivirus programs.</li>
  <li>Virus scans and scanning downloads.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="encryption-and-decryption">Encryption and Decryption</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Another layer of data protection.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="encryption">Encryption</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Encoding data to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="decryption">Decryption</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Decoding encrypted data.</li>
  <li>Similar to a translator but more advanced and secure.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="types-of-encryption">Types of Encryption</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Symmetric
    <ul>
      <li>1 key for both sender and receiver (e.g., Caesar cipher).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Asymmetric
    <ul>
      <li>Public key encryption, private key decryption</li>
      <li>Enhances security by using separate keys for encryption and decryption.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For example: I have a public key and a private key. I send my public key to David, and he sends his to me. He uses my public key to encrypt a message, then sends it back to me. I then can use my private key to decrypt this message.</p>

<p>Then, I can uses his public key to encrypt a message to send to him, and he can use his private key to decrypt it.</p>

<p>This way, no matter what, our private keys are not accessible anywhere, and people can only encrypt messages if our public keys are leaked, and not decrypt them.</p>

<h2 id="popcorn-hack-2">Popcorn Hack #2</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Let’s say we have an encrypted message “mjqqt”. If the Caesar cipher shifted the letters by 5, what is the original message?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="risks-to-personal-safety">Risks to personal safety</h2>
<h4 id="phising-schemes">Phising Schemes</h4>
<p>An attempt to trick a user ihnto providing personal information,like your usernames and passwords, account numbers, or social numbers.</p>

<p><strong>Phishing emails often look like they’re from a company you know and trust:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Your bank</li>
  <li>Your credit card company</li>
  <li>Social networking site</li>
  <li>Video streaming service</li>
  <li>Online store</li>
</ul>

<p>They trick you in clicking a link or opening an attachment</p>

<p>Clicking a link or opening an attachment in a phising email will cause enexpected harm leading to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Viruses installed on your computer</li>
  <li>Spoofed banking website</li>
  <li>Keylogger installed</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Keylogger:</strong>
Records every keystroke made by a user in ordcer to gain fradulent access to passwords or other confidential information</p>

<p><strong>Rouge access point:</strong>
A wirelesss network that can give unauthorized access to secure networks.</p>

<p>How can people access your information?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Routers</li>
  <li>Advertisments</li>
  <li>Attachements</li>
  <li>Pop ups</li>
</ul>
