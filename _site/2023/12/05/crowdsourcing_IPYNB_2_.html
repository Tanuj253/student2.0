  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Crowdsourcing is a method of obtaining information, ideas, services, or content by soliciting contributions from a large group of people, particularly from an online community, rather than from traditional employees or suppliers. This approach leverages the collective intelligence and skills of a vast, diverse crowd to solve problems, generate ideas, and complete tasks.</p>

<p>Definition: Crowdsourcing combines the words “crowd” and “outsourcing.” It was first coined by Jeff Howe in a 2006 Wired magazine article. The concept is based on the idea that a large group of people can collectively contribute more diverse and substantial input than an individual or small team.</p>

<h1 id="examples-of-data-sets">Examples of Data sets</h1>

<h2 id="kaggle">Kaggle</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Courses in visualization, tensorflow ai , and machine learning</li>
  <li>Competitons - cash prizes, props</li>
  <li>Notebooks- code, data, etc</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="google-public-datasets">Google public datasets</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Free for the 1st terabyte</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="datagov">Data.gov</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Uses government data to analyze markets, etc</li>
  <li>Agriculture, energy, water, health</li>
</ul>

<p>Widespread access to information and public data facilitates the identification of problems, development of solutions, and dissemination of results.</p>

<p>What is distributed computing?</p>

<p>Distributed computing</p>

<ul>
  <li>Donate spare computing power to help other apps function</li>
</ul>

<p>Example:</p>
<h3 id="boinc---university-of-california-berkley">Boinc - University of California Berkley</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Mathematics</li>
  <li>Astrophysics</li>
  <li>Climate</li>
  <li>Minecraft
    <ul>
      <li>If you’ve ever played minecraft you should know what a map seed is. The algorithm in minecraft uses the seed to develop the world that people play on. This is another example of distributed computing.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These projects uses excess computing power in order to run these operations and projects. It is where individuals or organizations obtain ideas, services, or content by using contributions from a large group of individuals typically from an online community.</p>
