<p>There are many key parts to managing and finishing a project.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/jm1021/alienWorld#readme">README.md</a>.   This contains information to help someone get started with the project.   The alienWorld repository was built from NightHawk pages, so much of the README already contained many development guidelines.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://jm1021.github.io/alienWorld/c4.1/2023/10/05/Plan_IPYNB_2_.html">Project Plan</a>.  This contains a project plan and guide.   This contains plan for the project and overviews the key elements of code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/jm1021/alienWorld/issues">Issue Management</a>.  Issues help drive the work of the project.  Open issues are assigned to individuals.  Closed issues contain history of work that has been completed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://jm1021.github.io/alienWorld/blogs/">GitHub Pages Blog</a>.  A big advantage of GitHub Pages as a frontend is that allows for classic frontend runtime and blogging to be contained in one place.  In education, a huge part of our project is how it was made, and how we collaborated, and how we progressed through steps.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://jm1021.github.io/alienWorld/compsci/">GitHub Pages History/Time Box</a>.  Managing meetings and capturing history tell a big story for a team.  Time Boxing history is a great way to share key elements of project.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://jm1021.github.io/alienWorld/c4.1/2023/10/05/Plan_IPYNB_2_.html#anatomy-of-alien-world">Anatomy of Alien World</a>.  This contains key thinking that went into designing code.  This was build in same document as Project Plan.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Code Comments.  Almost everyone, including Teachers, do not remeber how code works withou comments.  Be sure to comment key code block and algorithms.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
