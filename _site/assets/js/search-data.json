            "content": "Jinja 2 Overview . Jinja2 is a templating engine for Python. | Widely used in web development frameworks like Flask and Django. | Supports template inheritance for creating modular and reusable code. | Provides flexible syntax for embedding Python-like expressions in templates. | Offers built-in filters for data manipulation and formatting. | Supports control structures like loops and conditionals. | Automatically escapes HTML characters by default, enhancing web application security. | . Creating and Migrating database . The first object is to create and migrate a database. Run the script below to ensure database is created, primed, and has some starting data. Anytime a developer changes schema, this script needs to be run. . # Setup database and init data # open terminal to root directory of project ./migrate.sh . # Set environment variables export FLASK_APP=main export PYTHONPATH=.:$PYTHONPATH . These lines set environment variables. FLASK_APP is set to main, indicating the main Flask application to be run. PYTHONPATH is updated to include the current directory, allowing Python to find modules and packages in the current directory. | . # Check if sqlite3 is installed if ! command -v sqlite3 &amp;&gt; /dev/null; then echo &quot;Error: sqlite3 is not installed. Please install it before running this script.&quot; exit 1 fi . This block checks if the sqlite3 command is available. If not, it displays an error message and exits with a status code of 1. | . # Check if python3 is installed if ! command -v python3 &amp;&gt; /dev/null; then echo &quot;Error: python3 is not installed. Please install it before running this script.&quot; exit 1 fi . Similar to the previous block, this one checks for the presence of python3 command and exits with an error message if it’s not found. | . # Check if Flask is installed if ! python3 -m flask --version &amp;&gt; /dev/null; then echo &quot;Error: Flask is not installed. Please install it before running this script.&quot; exit 1 fi . This block checks if Flask is installed by attempting to run python3 -m flask –version. If Flask is not found, it exits with an error message. | . # Check if the migration directory exists if [ ! -d &quot;migrations&quot; ]; then echo &quot;Initializing migration for the first time...&quot; python3 -m flask db init fi . This section checks if the directory migrations exists. If not, it initializes Flask database migrations using python3 -m flask db init. | . # . restore from backup before migration if [ ! -e &quot;instance/volumes/sqlite.db&quot; ] &amp;&amp; [ -e &quot;instance/volumes/sqlite-backup.db&quot; ]; then echo &quot;No sqlite.db found, using sqlite-backup.db to generate the file.&quot; # Copy backup file to primary (sqlite.db) cp &quot;instance/volumes/sqlite-backup.db&quot; &quot;instance/volumes/sqlite.db&quot; # Extract the new Alembic version from the backup database backup_version=$(sqlite3 instance/volumes/sqlite.db &quot;SELECT version_num FROM alembic_version;&quot;) echo &quot;Version ${backup_version} detected&quot; python3 -m flask db stamp &quot;${backup_version}&quot; # Check if sqlite.db exists # . backup before migration elif [ -e &quot;instance/volumes/sqlite.db&quot; ]; then # Create a timestamp for the backup file timestamp=$(date &quot;+%Y%m%d%H%M%S&quot;) backup_file=&quot;instance/volumes/sqlite-backup-${timestamp}.db&quot; # Backup SQLite database sqlite3 instance/volumes/sqlite.db &quot;.backup instance/volumes/sqlite-backup.db&quot; sqlite3 instance/volumes/sqlite.db &quot;.backup ${backup_file}&quot; fi # Perform database migrations python3 -m flask db migrate # Perform database upgrade python3 -m flask db upgrade # Run a custom command to generate data python3 -m flask custom generate_data . In-depth look of this piece . if [ ! -e &quot;instance/volumes/sqlite.db&quot; ] &amp;&amp; [ -e &quot;instance/volumes/sqlite-backup.db&quot; ]; then . This line checks if sqlite.db does not exist (! -e “instance/volumes/sqlite.db”) AND sqlite-backup.db exists (-e “instance/volumes/sqlite-backup.db”). If both conditions are true, the code block inside the if statement will be executed. | . echo &quot;No sqlite.db found, using sqlite-backup.db to generate the file.&quot; . This line simply prints a message indicating that sqlite.db is not found and sqlite-backup.db will be used to generate the file. | . cp &quot;instance/volumes/sqlite-backup.db&quot; &quot;instance/volumes/sqlite.db&quot; . This line copies the contents of sqlite-backup.db to sqlite.db, essentially restoring the database from the backup file. | . backup_version=$(sqlite3 instance/volumes/sqlite.db &quot;SELECT version_num FROM alembic_version;&quot;) echo &quot;Version ${backup_version} detected&quot; . Here, it retrieves the version number (version_num) from the alembic_version table of the newly restored database (sqlite.db) using the sqlite3 command-line tool. It then prints out the detected version number. | . python3 -m flask db stamp &quot;${backup_version}&quot; . This line runs a Flask database migration command (python3 -m flask db stamp) and passes the detected version number (“${backup_version}”) as an argument. This essentially stamps the database with the detected version number, indicating that it is up to date with the migrations corresponding to that version. | . elif [ -e &quot;instance/volumes/sqlite.db&quot; ]; then . The elif part of the script handles the situation where sqlite.db already exists: | This line checks if sqlite.db exists. If it does, the code block inside the elif statement will be executed. | . timestamp=$(date &quot;+%Y%m%d%H%M%S&quot;) backup_file=&quot;instance/volumes/sqlite-backup-${timestamp}.db&quot; . These lines generate a timestamp and create a unique backup file name based on the timestamp. | . sqlite3 instance/volumes/sqlite.db &quot;.backup instance/volumes/sqlite-backup.db&quot; sqlite3 instance/volumes/sqlite.db &quot;.backup ${backup_file}&quot; . This pair of commands backs up the existing sqlite.db database. It first creates a general backup named sqlite-backup.db and then creates a timestamped backup file (sqlite-backup-${timestamp}.db). | . python3 -m flask db migrate . Initiates database migrations using Flask’s migration system. | These migration scripts capture changes such as adding or modifying tables, columns, or indexes in the database schema. | . python3 -m flask db upgrade . Applies database migrations to the database. | After running this command, the database structure reflects the changes specified in the migration scripts. | . python3 -m flask custom generate_data . Executes a custom Flask command to generate data. | The custom command generate_data may perform tasks such as populating the database with initial data, creating sample records for testing purposes, or performing any other data generation tasks required by the application. | . Summary and Purpose . Database Environment Setup: It ensures that the necessary environment variables are set to facilitate the Flask application’s operation. | Dependency Checks: It checks if essential dependencies (sqlite3, python3, and Flask) are installed on the system. This helps ensure that the script can run successfully. | Flask Migration Initialization: If the migrations directory doesn’t exist, it initializes Flask database migrations. This is a crucial step in managing database schema changes over time. | Database Backup and Restore: It handles scenarios where the main database (sqlite.db) may need to be restored from a backup (sqlite-backup.db) before migration. This ensures data integrity during the migration process. | Database Migration: It performs database migrations using Flask’s migration commands. This step is essential for applying schema changes and updates to the database structure. | Data Generation: Finally, it executes a custom command (generate_data) to generate additional data, which can be useful for testing or initializing the application with some starting data. | .",

User ID: . Password: . Login . 3. Justin (CRUD) . To create and register a user, you can using the existing code in user.py in the api folder and update it, like this: We used Teacher’s code as a reference here: . We first had a class for creating a user/fetching data from all the users. This would just be our normal localhost link. Since we are using users.py in the api folder, our link is just /users here. . class _CRUD(Resource): # User API operation for Create, Read. The post function creates users and and the get. The Read(GET) function in this case gets data from all users, which we are planning to use for a leaderboard. def post(self): # Create method &#39;&#39;&#39; Read data for json body &#39;&#39;&#39; body = request.get_json() &#39;&#39;&#39; Avoid garbage in, error checking &#39;&#39;&#39; # validate name name = body.get(&#39;name&#39;) if name is None or len(name) &lt; 2: return {&#39;message&#39;: f&#39;Name is missing, or is less than 2 characters&#39;}, 400 # validate uid uid = body.get(&#39;uid&#39;) if uid is None or len(uid) &lt; 2: return {&#39;message&#39;: f&#39;User ID is missing, or is less than 2 characters&#39;}, 400 # look for password and dob password = body.get(&#39;password&#39;) dob = body.get(&#39;dob&#39;) coins = 0 tracking = body.get(&#39;tracking&#39;) #validate tracking # exercise = body.get(&#39;exercise&#39;) #validate exercise &#39;&#39;&#39; #1: Key code block, setup USER OBJECT &#39;&#39;&#39; uo = User(name=name, #user name uid=uid, tracking=tracking, exercise=exercise, dob=dob, coins=coins) if password is not None: uo.set_password(password) # convert to date type # if dob is not None: # try: # uo.dob = datetime.strptime(dob, &#39;%Y-%m-%d&#39;).date() # except: # return {&#39;message&#39;: f&#39;Date of birth format error {dob}, must be mm-dd-yyyy&#39;}, 400 if tracking is not None: uo.tracking = tracking if exercise is not None: uo.exercise = exercise &#39;&#39;&#39; #2: Key Code block to add user to database &#39;&#39;&#39; # create user in database user = uo.create() # success returns json of user if user: #return jsonify(user.read()) return user.read() # failure returns error return {&#39;message&#39;: f&#39;Processed {name}, either a format error or User ID {uid} is duplicate&#39;}, 400 def get(self): # Read Method users = User.query.all() # read/extract all users from database json_ready = [user.read() for user in users] # prepare output in json #return jsonify(json_ready) # jsonify creates Flask response object, more specific to APIs than json.dumps return (json_ready) . To update and delete a user, you need their specific information (id). So, we have a seperate class with a seperate link. To update information and fetch old information, we have another get method here as well just to get data from a specific user rather than all users. . class _UD(Resource): def put(self, user_id): body = request.get_json() user_id = body.get(&#39;id&#39;) if user_id is None: return {&#39;message&#39;: &#39;Id not found.&#39;}, 400 user = User.query.filter_by(id=user_id).first() # Use filter_by to query by UID if user: if &#39;exercise&#39; and &#39;tracking&#39; in body: user.exercise = body[&#39;exercise&#39;] user.update() user.tracking = body[&#39;tracking&#39;] user.update() return user.read() return {&#39;message&#39;: &#39;You may only update tracking or exercise&#39;}, 400 return {&#39;message&#39;: &#39;User not found.&#39;}, 404 def get(self, user_id): user = User.query.filter_by(id=user_id).first() if user: return user.read() # Assuming you have a &#39;read&#39; method in your User model return {&#39;message&#39;: &#39;User not found.&#39;}, 404 . 4. Login Process/Signup Isabel . The login was a bit tricky to implement, because I had to modify things from the old flask-portfolio I was already working on. As our teacher has mentioned already, we can either fork the new cpt repository to start our Login or we can make changes to an existing repository. Since I started thinking about CRUD ahead, I decided to use the repositroy I already had and made some changes. Here is the link to the teachers changes if you started out like me and like the old format better: Flask Portfolio With JWT . class _Security(Resource): def post(self): try: body = request.get_json() if not body: return jsonify({ &quot;message&quot;: &quot;Please provide user details&quot;, &quot;data&quot;: None, &quot;error&quot;: &quot;Bad request&quot; }), 400 uid = body.get(&#39;uid&#39;) password = body.get(&#39;password&#39;) if uid is None or password is None: return jsonify({&#39;message&#39;: &#39;User ID or password is missing&#39;}), 400 user = User.query.filter_by(_uid=uid).first() if not user or not user.is_password(password): return jsonify({&#39;message&#39;: &quot;Invalid user ID or password&quot;}), 400 token = self.generate_token(user) # Additional response data print(&quot;User Object:&quot;, user) response_data = { &quot;message&quot;: f&quot;Authentication for {user._uid} successful&quot;, &quot;data&quot;: { # I needed to send this data to the frontend so that I can implement crud. &quot;jwt&quot;: token, &quot;user&quot;: { &#39;name&#39;: user.name, &#39;id&#39;: user.id } } } resp = jsonify(response_data) resp.set_cookie(&quot;jwt&quot;, token, max_age=3600, secure=True, httponly=True, path=&#39;/&#39; ) return resp except Exception as e: return jsonify({ &quot;message&quot;: &quot;Something went wrong!&quot;, &quot;error&quot;: str(e), &quot;data&quot;: None }), 500 def generate_token(self, user): # Notice how I put the generate token within the security function. Teacher did not do that. He called the function with a decorator and created a middle ware py file. I didn&#39;t do that and I put in directly instead try: token = jwt.encode( {&quot;_uid&quot;: user._uid}, current_app.config[&quot;SECRET_KEY&quot;], algorithm=&quot;HS256&quot; ) return token except Exception as e: return jsonify({ &quot;error&quot;: &quot;Something went wrong during token generation&quot;, &quot;message&quot;: str(e) }), 500 . Here is the video for reference using postman! . Video Postman Login Test . 6. Best Practices and Additional Features Vibja . Brief discussion on additional security features (e.g., email verification, two-factor authentication). | Emphasis on following best practices for security and privacy. &lt;!– Suggestions Use HTTPS (SSL/TLS): Ensure that all communication between clients and the server is encrypted using HTTPS. This helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and protects sensitive information during transmission. | . Token-Based Authentication: Implement token-based authentication, such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or OAuth, to securely manage user sessions. Tokens should be generated securely, have a limited lifespan, and be securely stored on the client side. . Secure Password Storage: Hash and salt passwords before storing them in the database. Use strong hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt) to protect user passwords from being exposed in the event of a data breach. . Authentication Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks on login endpoints. This can involve limiting the number of login attempts within a specified time period to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access. . Secure User Registration: Implement validation and sanitization checks on user registration inputs to prevent injection attacks. Verify the authenticity of email addresses and usernames during the registration process. . Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Encourage or require users to enable MFA to add an additional layer of security. This can involve using one-time codes sent via SMS, email, or authenticator apps. . Session Management: Implement secure session management practices. Ensure that session tokens are securely stored and transmitted, and consider implementing session timeout and re-authentication mechanisms. . Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection: Implement measures to protect against CSRF attacks. Use anti-CSRF tokens and ensure that requests from legitimate users originate from trusted sources. . Input Validation and Sanitization: Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks, such as SQL injection or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Use parameterized queries for database interactions. . Logging and Monitoring: Implement comprehensive logging for login/signup activities. Monitor and log failed login attempts, unusual patterns, and potential security events to detect and respond to security incidents. . API Key Security: If applicable, secure API keys used for authentication and authorization. Ensure that keys are kept confidential, rotated regularly, and that access is restricted to only necessary entities. . Regular Security Audits and Updates: Conduct regular security audits of your codebase and dependencies. Stay updated on security best practices and promptly apply patches and updates to address any vulnerabilities. –&gt; .",

Encourgae further exploration of Flask and more comples SQL operations. . Database and SQLAlchemy . Overview . This section introduces the use of SQLAlchemy with a SQLite database to demonstrate how programs interact with data, emphasizing the iterative, interactive nature of processing information and managing data using classes and tables. It aligns with the College Board’s emphasis on program usage, managing data, insight, filter systems, and application in programming. . Imports and Flask Objects . Purpose . The imports initialize the Flask app and SQLAlchemy, which are essential for creating a web application connected to a database. . Flask app object . This is the core of the Flask application, used for handling web requests. . SQLAlchemy db object . This is the core of the ORM, used for database interactions in an object-oriented manner. . Model Definition . Class User and db.Model Inheritance . This is where the User model is defined, inheriting from db.Model of SQLAlchemy, which facilitates database operations in an object-oriented way. . Init Method and Property Decorators . The init method sets up the initial state of the User object, while @property and setter methods define how to access and modify the object’s attributes. . CRUD Methods . Methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records in the database are defined here, making use of SQLAlchemy’s ORM capabilities for streamlined database interactions. . Inital Data . Function initUsers . This function initializes the database and populates it with test data using User model instances. The use of try/except blocks ensures graceful handling of errors, such as duplicate data. Check for Given Credentials . Fuctionality . The find_by_uid function retrieves a user from the database based on the unique identifier, while check_credentials validates user credentials. . SQLAlchemy Use . Utilizes SQLAlchemy’s query-building methods for efficient database searches. . Create a New User . Process . The create function demonstrates adding a new user to the database, showcasing input handling, object initialization, and error management. . User Creation Logic . Involves checking for existing users, handling date inputs, and using the custom create method of the User model for database insertion. . Reading Users Table . Method . The read function uses SQLAlchemy’s query.all method to retrieve all users from the database. . Data Formatting . Implements list comprehension to format the user data into a JSON-friendly structure, making it easier to handle in web applications. . Hacks (Suggestions for Extension) . Persionalization . Encourages reader to implement these examples in their own projects, adapting and expanding upon the CRUD fuctionality. . Enhancements . Suggests adding update and delete functionalities to provide a comprehensive undetstanding of CRUD operations in a databsae context .",

            "title": "P2 | SASS",
            "content": "Introduction to Basic SASS . What is SASS? . A preprocessor language that’s interpreted into CSS Takes input data and converts it to an output that’s used as input by another program. | Basically converting your code to CSS to be run by browser | . | . SCSS vs CSS . CSS changes the style of your webpage CSS can be really annoying to use as it lacks features | Ex: Layout inconsistency across phones and webpages; lacking nesting (where objects contain other similar objects); creating responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes; and more | . | SCSS is basically a CSS version on crack. So like much better SCSS just has more features that makes things more convenient | . | CSS better for simple styling in small projects with little customization | SCSS better for complex styling and working in projects with multiple pages with lots of customization | . SASS benefits . Nesting Capabilities: A way of writing CSS styles that mimics the structure of your HTML. Instead of writing separate selectors, you can nest them inside each other. In the example below: In the nested example, the p selector is inside the .container selector. This can make your styles more readable and mirrors the HTML structure. Just be mindful not to over-nest, as it may lead to overly specific and harder-to-maintain styles. | . | . CSS: .container { width: 100%; } .container p { color: #333; } SCSS: .container { width: 100%; p { color: #333; } } . Modular Approach: Split CSS into partial files, enhancing project organization. | Use of Variables: Easily update and maintain consistency with defined variables. Ex: in CSS to make something blue you’d have to constantly write “color: #0000FF”. In SCSS you can define “$blue: #0000FF”, and then for the rest of the code just write “color: $blue” to make something blue | . | Mixins for Reusable Code: Create reusable code pieces for elements like buttons and forms. | Extend/Inheritance: Share CSS properties between selectors, reducing code redundancy. | Control Directives: Use if/else statements and for/each loops in CSS. | Built-in Functions: Functions for color manipulation, mathematics, and more. | Compatibility: Automatically handles browser prefixing for cross-browser support. | . Modular SCSS . Organizing your CSS code into smaller pieces better readability, reusability, and maintenance | . | Each piece (module) focuses on a specific part easier to work with, collaborate, and update. | . | Think of it like having separate folders for different types of styles, so your code is more organized and manageable. | To use it: Add _ before the filenames (e.g., _filename.scss) to create partials. Import partials into the main SCSS file without the _. | . // _header.scss .header { // Styles for header component } // _footer.scss .footer { // Styles for footer component } // main.scss @import &#39;header&#39;; // No need for the underscore @import &#39;footer&#39;; // Styles for other components in the main file . Advanced SASS . Operators: . Developers use operators to perform dynamic calculations within stylesheets. For example, they can use mathematical operators (+, -, *, /) to dynamically adjust sizes, positions, or other style properties based on certain conditions or user interactions. | . Conditional Statements: . Conditional statements like @if, @else, and @else if allow developers to apply different styles based on conditions. This is crucial for creating interactive interfaces where styles change dynamically in response to user actions or application state. | . Loops: . Loops, such as @for and @each, enable developers to iterate through lists of values or apply styles multiple times. This is useful for creating repetitive elements in a dynamic way or for handling dynamic data structures. | . Functions: . Functions in SASS enable developers to encapsulate complex logic and calculations. This is valuable for creating dynamic styles that respond to various inputs or conditions. For instance, developers can use functions to calculate and set styles based on user preferences or device characteristics. | . Built-in Functions: . Developers leverage built-in functions for math, color manipulation, and string manipulation to dynamically generate styles. This can be especially useful in creating color schemes, responsive layouts, and other interactive design elements. | . Extending &amp; Inheritance: . Extending styles with @extend allows developers to share common styles among selectors, reducing redundancy. This is beneficial for creating consistent and easily maintainable styles. In interactive designs, maintaining consistency becomes crucial as styles may change dynamically. | .

            "content": "Problem 10 . The correct answer was B not C because regular guided tour tickets are erroneously set to 8, when they should be adjusted to 10, aligning with the correct quantity. Similarly, regular general admission tickets and child guided tour tickets are incorrectly set to 6 when they should be modified to 8, reflecting the accurate values for these ticket types. Rectifying these values not only ensures consistency but also brings the calculations in line with the intended ticket pricing structure. . Problem 15 . The correct answer was A not C because the discrepancy arises from the distinct initializations of variable i in the two programs. Program A prints i and then increments it, while program B increments i and then prints it. Addressing this inconsistency requires adjusting the loop structure to ensure that both programs handle the variable i in a consistent manner, ultimately leading to the correct output. . Problem 16 . The correct answer was D not A because the deviation occurs in the incorrect incrementation of the index. Contrary to the original code where the index is incremented, the correction involves decrementing the index. Placing this decrement between lines 7 and 8 ensures that all elements are correctly checked, aligning the loop with its intended functionality. . Problem 27 . The correct answer was D not C because the misconception lies in the belief that problems solvable computationally are dependent on an internet connection. The correction involves recognizing that problems that can be solved computationally do not necessarily require an internet connection. Understanding this distinction is crucial for accurately selecting the appropriate choice. . Problem 28 . The correct answer was B not D because the issue stems from both variables being erroneously assigned the initial value of alpha. To rectify this, the correction involves assigning distinct variables their respective values, ensuring that the program operates as intended and produces the correct results. . Problem 29 . The correct answer was A not C because the misunderstanding lies in the assumption that removing a file’s metadata allows for the reconstruction of the original data. Clarifying this concept reveals that removing metadata does not facilitate the reconstruction of the original data. Recognizing this limitation is essential for a more precise evaluation. . Problem 34 . The correct answer was C not A because the mistake is in the third call to BotMover, where the robot attempts to move forward off the edge of the grid. The correction involves ensuring that the robot’s movement stays within the defined grid boundaries, preventing unintended consequences and ensuring the correct execution of the program. . Problem 50 . The correct answer was D not B because the misconception lies in the belief that Algorithm I and II worked in a reasonable time but Algorithm III did not. Acknowledging that all three algorithms worked efficiently is crucial for the accurate evaluation of their performance, leading to the correct choice. . Problem 56 . The correct answer was A not D because the discrepancy arises from the incorrect assumption that version II takes less time than version I. Recognizing that version II actually takes longer than version I is crucial for the accurate assessment of their relative efficiency. . Problem 58 . The correct answer was C not A because the misunderstanding stems from the false evaluation of the expression y = z. Recognizing that this expression evaluates to false ensures that the intended result of false is returned, aligning with the correct interpretation of the code. . Problem 59 . The correct answer was C not D because the misconception lies in the assumption that open-source software can be continually updated by the original developers. Clarifying this concept reveals that open-source software can be updated by the public even without the involvement of the original developers. Understanding this nature is essential for a more accurate understanding of open-source development. . Problem 60 . The correct answer was D not A because the error occurs in the third line of code, where count is incorrectly assigned as the length of bothList (12) minus the length of bothList (7). Correcting this calculation to determine the correct length ensures that the program produces the intended result and avoids the incorrect outcome. . Problem 62 . The correct answer was A and B not D because the misconception arises from the false evaluation of x AND y, which leads to the body of the IF statement not being executed. Understanding the logic of the AND operation ensures the correct interpretation of the code and accurate control flow. . Problem 63 . The correct answer was A and B not A and D because the misunderstanding lies in the incorrect assessment of how the total amount of money for selling all copies of a book is calculated. The correction involves recognizing that the quantity available for each book is multiplied by its selling price, leading to the accurate calculation of the total amount of money received. . Problem 64 . The correct answer was B &amp; D not C because the mistake is in the repeated addition of -2 to the result five times, resulting in the intended product of -10. Understanding the correct application of the procedure ensures that the program produces the intended product instead of an unintended one. . Problem 65 . The correct answer was B &amp; C not A &amp; D because the misconception lies in the assumption that the code concatenates substrings “lope” and “jacka” in a different way. Recognizing that the code correctly concatenates these substrings and stores the result as “lopejacka” in the variable ‘animal’ ensures the accurate interpretation of the code. . Problem 66 . The correct answer was A &amp; C not B &amp; D because the misunderstanding arises from the incorrect incrementation of the variable count and the placement of currentNum inside the loop. The correction involves incrementing count within the body of the IF statement when currentNum is a perfect number and ensuring that currentNum is incremented inside the loop but outside the body of the IF statement. These adjustments ensure the correct counting of perfect numbers within the specified range. . Problem 67 . The correct answer was A&amp;B and not C because the chosen code accurately produces the intended output, contrary to the assumption of unintended output. Recognizing the correct code for the intended output is crucial for the accurate interpretation of the program and selecting the correct option. . Reflection . While I am not entirely satisfied with my score of 49 out of 67, I view it as an opportunity for personal development. Analyzing my mistakes will enable me to concentrate on areas where I face challenges and enhance my understanding. To review and reinforce my knowledge, I plan to revisit team lectures and watch instructional YouTube videos explaining the intricacies of each topic and what is expected by College Board. Despite my reservations about the score, I believe I have gained valuable insights and knowledge, contributing to my overall progress and growth throughout this trimester and in this specific class. Having a new team gives me optimism, as I anticipate receiving support from my teammates to address and improve upon my weaknesses in the course. .",

            "content": "What is an Undecidable Problem? . Some problems take a very long time to solve, so we use algorithms that give approximate solutions. There are some problems that a computer can never solve, even the world’s most powerful computer with infinite time: the undecidable problems. . An decidable problem is a decision problem for which an algorithm can be written to produce a correct number for all inputs (eg: is the number even) (Collegeboard AAP-4.B.1) | An undecidable problem is one for which no algorith can be constructed that is always capable of providing a correct yes-or-no answer. (Collegeboard AAP-4.B.2) An undecidable problem may have some instances that have an algorthimic solution, but there is no algorithmic solution that could solve all instances of the problem. | . Popcorn Hack 1 . 1. Review of the Definition of an Undecided Problem . A company is developing a tool to detect “unreachable code”: code in a program that will never be executed because no paths ever lead to that line of code. They want to release the tool with the promise that it will “find and delete 100% of the unreachable code in your codebase!” Unfortunately, one of the programmers does some research and realizes that determining whether a line of code is unreachable is an undecidable problem. . What are the consequences of the problem being undecidable? . A. The programmers can come up with an algorithm that will find 100% of the unreachable code, but it would take an unreasonable amount of time to run. . B. The programmers can come up with an algorithm that correctly determines unreachable code most of the time, but it will not correctly identify unreachable code in all cases. . C. The programmers may be able to come up with an algorithm to find 100% of the unreachable code, but nobody has come up with the algorithm yet, so they will need more development time. . D. The tool will not be able to correctly identify any cases of unreachable code. . Solution B is the correct answer as the definition of an undecided problem states that an algorithm may be able to solve the problem in some cases but no algorithm exists to solve all cases. Halting Problem . The Halting Problem is a classic example of an undecidable problem in computer science, formulated by Alan Turing in the 1930s. It addresses the fundamental question of whether a program, given any input, will eventually halt (terminate) or run indefinitely (enter an infinite loop). . The essence of the Halting Problem revolves around creating an algorithm that can accurately determine, for any program and input, whether that program will halt or continue running forever. Alan Turing proved that such an algorithm cannot exist. . For example, consider this program that counts down: . That program will halt, since num eventually becomes 0. Compare that to this program that counts up: . It counts up forever, since num will never equal 0. Algorithms do exist that can correctly predict that the first program halts and the second program never does. These are simple programs which don’t change based on different inputs. However, no algorithm exists that can analyze any program’s code and determine whether it halts or not. . Popcorn Hack 2 . 2. Review of the Halting Problem . Which of the following options best summarizes the Halting Problem? . A. The Halting Problem is a decision problem in computability theory that seeks to determine whether a given algorithm will halt or run indefinitely for all possible inputs. . B. The Halting Problem is a sorting algorithm designed to arrange elements in ascending order. . C. The Halting Problem is a protocol used to secure communications over the internet. . D. The Halting Problem is a theorem in number theory that deals with prime numbers. . Solution A is the correct answer as the Halting Problem was Turing&#39;s proof of the existence of an undecided problem. Turing’s Proof Through Contradiction: . defintion proof through contradiction: a form of proof that assumes a claim false and shows that this state leads to a known contradiction; therefore, the claim must be true . We assume the halting algoritm exists So here’s the basic code flowchart for the halting algorithm: | Here’s the reverser (which consists of its halting algorithm) which basically does the opposite of the halting algoritm returns. . The Reverser works on programs such as Count Up or Count Down until 0. . The contradiction But if we plug Reverser into itself…. | Reverser does the opposite of HaltChecker so HaltChecker can never be right. . Yellow path: If HaltChecker says that Reverser never halts; the Reverser will halt | Green Path: If HaltCheck says Reverser halts; the Reverser will never halt | . However, we said that HaltChecker exists and is always correct. . Conclusion Therefore, HaltChecker cannot exist. | Implications and Other Undecidable Problems . Consequences: Because proof of the Halting Problem is undecidable, this has implications in the field of computer science. There are consequences for the theory of computation, algorithmic complexity, and the limits of what can be achieved with computers. | . | . The Post Correspondence Problem (PCP) Definition: A mathematical problem that involves a set of rectangular tiles, each marked with a string of symbols on the top and bottom. The challenge is to determine whether a sequence of these tiles exists such that when they are arranged in a line (either horizontally or vertically), the strings on the top and bottom of the tiles match. | . | Undecidability: Alan Turing demonstrated that no algorithm can determine this sequence for all sets of tiles from the Turing machine not accepting the post correspondence input. Because it is simpler than the halting problem and the Entscheidungsproblem it is often used in proofs of undecidability. | . | . | . | Rice’s Theorem Definition: Any non-trivial property about the behavior of a computer program is undecidable. “non-trivial property” means a property that is true for some programs and false for others | . | . | Undecidability: If you have a question about what a program does that is interesting, there is no algorithm that can always give you the correct answer. | . | The Collatz Conjecture Definition: is a mathematical hypothesis that posits that, no matter what positive integer you start with, the rule states that if the current number is even, divide it by 2; if it’s odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. Despite its apparent simplicity, proving or disproving the conjecture remains an unsolved problem in mathematics. | . | Undecidability: Sequence will always end up reaches 4-2-1 from any starting number and will loop infintely since 1 is odd leading back to 4. | . | . | The Tiling Problem Definition: Determines if a given shape can be tiled perfectly without gaps or overlaps. The objective is to find a way to arrange the tiles to fill the entire area of the given shape. The challenge is to determine if a valid tiling arrangement exists and, if so, to find one or more solutions. | . | Undecidability: Proving whether an arbitrary shape can be tiled without gaps or overlaps is undecidable. | . | The Entscheidungsproblem Definition: The Entscheidungsproblem, or Decision Problem in English, was a question in the field of mathematical logic posed by David Hilbert in 1928. It asked whether there exists a general algorithm to determine the truth or falsity of any mathematical statement. This question led to important developments in the study of computability and laid the groundwork for the field of theoretical computer science. | . | Undecidability: In 1936 and 1937, Alonzo Church and Alan Turing showed independently, that there can be no answer to the Entscheidungsproblem. They showed that it is impossible for an algorithm to decide whether statements in arithmetic are true or false. For this reason, there can be no solution for the Entscheidungsproblem. This was proven by Alan Turing’s “Turing Machine” which was created in the 1930s. | . | . | . Popcorn Hack 3 . 3. Review of Alternative Examples of Undecided Problems .

Computing bias is a bias that exists within algorithms that unfairly discriminate against certain individuals or groups, creating unfair outcomes | Computing innovations reflect biases because algorithms and data are influenced by the people who contributed to it, so computing biases can be embedded at every level of development | Algorithm bias should be reduced so computer innovations can combat existing user bias | . . Popcorn Hack #1: . Which of the following scenarios is an example of computing bias? . A. An email filtering system accurately categorizes emails into spam and non-spam based on a diverse set of features, minimizing false positives and false negatives. B.

An image recognition algorithm identifies objects in photographs with high accuracy, regardless of the gender, ethnicity, or age of the individuals depicted. D. An automated hiring system consistently favors candidates from specific educational institutions and backgrounds, resulting in the exclusion of qualified applicants from diverse backgrounds. . Answer: D. An automated Hiring system consistently favors canidates from specific educational institutions and backgrounds, resulting in the exclusion of qualified applicants from diverse backgrounds. . Types of Computing Bias - Trevor . Computing bias can be either intentional or unintentional and as said before, this bias is a result of human biases in development. Here are some examples: . Data bias: when the data set does not reflect the real world values Ex: A company is developing an algorithm to see whether or not a product has positive or negative online reviews. However, the training data might over-represent overly negative or positive opinions that are posted online which wouldn’t reflect the real-world popularity of the product | . | Human bias: People who make the programs may bring in their own biases whether consciously or unconsciously Ex: A software development team is working on a code review algorithm. They all have experience using Language X and so they believe that developers using Language X are more qualified and so their algorithm reflects that. This uses their individual traits and applies it to the entire group of coders using Language X. | . | Algorithmic bias reflects the data bias and human bias and often amplifies it. However, bias can arise from the structure and decision making of the program itself Ex: A program is designed to automate the loan approval system. It uses information from income, employment history, and credit score. However, the algorithmn can produce biased results based on trends from certain job occupations which may disproportionally affect certain groups There are many more nuanced types of computing biases which you can find here: https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/fairness/types-of-bias | . | . Popcorn Hack #2: . An online example of computing bias is when an HP computer’s facial recognition system couldn’t track the face of someone with darker skin. Why is this and what type of bias is it? Do you think it was intentional or unintentional? . Explicit and Implicit Data - Lakshanya . Explicit data is information you give an app or site | Implicit data is the information it collects based on your activity | For example, with Netflix, the explicit data it collects includes your rating of movies (thumbs up, thumbs down) and your personal information. The implicit data it collects includes when you watch, what you binge, and the frequently selected genres. | This data collection is also known as user bias. More bias comes in when Netflix shows its exclusives before any of the regular items to gain subscriptions. | . . Popcorn Hack #3: . What is another scenario of data collection in everyday applications and situations? | . Mitigation Strategies: - Matthew . Obtain more diverse data (ex: racist computer) | Pre-processing: Writing an algorithm that adjusts to datasets to check for bias before using it as an input. It’s about cleaning up and organizing the raw data and makes it more suitable for building or training models. . | In-processing: This occurs during the processing or analysis of data within a system or model. The algorithm will manipulate and transform the data as it goes through the model during its active use.(ex: if the algorithm was processing images it would rescale the image to keep consistent dimensions) | . More Mitigation Strategies: - Aditya . Post-processing: This type of strategy is comprised of 3 parts, input correction, classifier correction, output correction . Input Correction: . What it is: Imagine you have a machine learning model that identifies objects in images. Input correction involves making adjustments to the images used to test the model after it has already been trained. . Example: If the model was trained mostly on pictures taken during the day, input correction might involve adjusting the brightness and color balance of images taken at night to make them more comparable. . Classifier Correction: . What it is: This step focuses on fine-tuning the algorithm or model after training to reduce any biases or discrimination it might have inadvertently learned. . Example: Suppose you have a model for hiring decisions, and you notice it tends to favor certain demographics. Classifier correction could involve tweaking the decision-making rules to ensure fair treatment for all groups. . Output Correction: . What it is: After the model makes predictions, output correction involves modifying those predictions to eliminate any biases or unwanted discrimination. . Example: If a language translation model tends to produce more errors when translating sentences from one language to another, output correction might involve adjusting the final translated sentences to be more accurate and fair. . In summary, post-processing is like a three-step check and adjustment process to ensure that a machine learning model behaves fairly and accurately, even after it has been trained. Input correction modifies the testing data, classifier correction fine-tunes the model, and output correction adjusts the final predictions. This helps in addressing issues like biases and discrimination that may arise during the model training process. . . Homework: . Problem: Biased Predictive Policing Algorithm: A city implements a predictive policing algorithm to allocate law enforcement resources more efficiently. However, concerns arise as community members and activists notice that the algorithm appears to disproportionately target certain neighborhoods, leading to over-policing and potential violations of civil rights. Provide a solution to how this situation can be resolved, and how the computing bias can be removed. Explain which method of mitigation you will use and how it works. .",

In Mr Mortensen’s most recent years in industry, there were many Lawyers making a profession on Patents and how they can be impacted on General Public Licensing (GPL). . Qualcomm makes its money on patents, if you use GPL software you could be voiding your rights to charge for software and patents. Open Source by nature, specifically GPL, says any derivative work is free and code should be shared. Qualcomm wants all derivative work to require a royalty payment payment, also anyone who uses the idea/patent pays royalty. . . From synopsis.com, “Black Duck® software composition analysis (SCA) helps teams manage the security, quality, and license compliance risks that come from the use of open source and third-party code in applications and containers.” Qualcomm has had 20 technical jobs and 3 lawyers analyzing all the code produced, analyzing code for Open Source inclusion, and analyzing impact of such licenses to its ability to charge royalties for the use of their Patents. . This may sound like a simple problem, but think about the Students of Today, often they are given an assignment and instead of developing their own algorithm they opt to copy something off the internet. Well, don’t think the Workers of Today are entirely different. In summary, it is important to know the type of software license you are copying, it could impact billions of dollars in business. .

The GNU GPLv3 also lets people do almost anything they want with your project, except distributing closed source versions. . Open source means the GitHub project must be public. . For a company like Qualcomm, they are required to institute many practices to deliver their code in parts (public vs private). Isolating their patent and secret code, far away from the GPL or Creative Commons code. In fact, a company that is protecting their patents may need to division engineers, split distribution, not deploy to public, etc. After distribution, the customer of the Patented (ie Qualcomm) product is required to put the public/private domain code back together again. . Legal and Ethically . We need to comply with the terms of licenses. We need to cite sources. (I am particularly bad with internet pictures. However, in the picture of the Black Duck above I am actually advertising the Company). . As consumers, we have become aware that Music and Movie companies own content. These companies build DRM (Digital Rights Management) software to protect, play, and/or distribute content. Most of us buy subscriptions to services.

In software, it can be more complicated to understand all the Creative Commons licenses and its impact to our own ideas and businesses. Mostly, if we use things in class, there is “no problem” with Open Source as our usage is considered educational use. Creative Commons software has enabled amazing innovation as we are able to do so much for free, as we have done in this class. However, Individuals and Companies are required to figure out techniques and business models in order to use Open Source software according to terms of license. . Long ago, I remember being amazed that Red Hat was not selling its Linux distribution, they were giving away the software. They had to! This was in the terms of the licenses they were using, GPL. However, as an early pioneers in Linux distributions, they established a business model around buying their support agreement. They rose in fortune, became a public company, and had an amazing Initial Public Offering (IPO).

            "content": "Lesson Ideas . Add to the basics of HasMap and HashSet below. Go over storing elements in SQL like HashMap and Collection. . Include SQL elements JSONB with HashMap | Include SQL ManyToMany relation with Collection | . Review addition materials like Roles and Activity Tracker https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/APCSA/1.b/2022/11/17/AP-frq2.html . Here are some SQL definitions in Person.java. . @ManyToMany(fetch = EAGER) private Collection&lt;PersonRole&gt; roles = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); /* HashMap is used to store JSON for daily &quot;stats&quot; &quot;stats&quot;: { &quot;2022-11-13&quot;: { &quot;calories&quot;: 2200, &quot;steps&quot;: 8000 } } */ @JdbcTypeCode(SqlTypes.JSON) @Column(columnDefinition = &quot;jsonb&quot;) private Map&lt;String,Map&lt;String, Object&gt;&gt; stats = new HashMap&lt;&gt;(); . HashMap . Below is an example using a HashMap and listed are some key things to consider when using this data structure. . Hashing: HashMap uses a hash function to map keys to their corresponding buckets. The hash function is used to compute the index of the array where the key-value pair should be stored. A good hash function should generate a unique hash code for each key, but collisions (i.e., two keys with the same hash code) can still occur. Hash map in Java does not maintain insertion order either by key or by the order inserted. . | Performance: HashMap provides constant-time performance (O(1)) for get() and put() operations, as long as the hash function is well-distributed and there are no hash collisions. However, in the worst case, the performance of a HashMap can degrade to O(n), where n is the number of elements in the map. . | Key and value types: HashMap allows any non-null object as a key, and any object (including null) as a value. However, to use a class as a key, it must implement the equals() and hashCode() methods. HashMap uses the equals() method to check if two keys are equal, and the hashCode() method to generate the hash code for the key. . | Iteration: HashMap provides several ways to iterate over the key-value pairs in the map, including using keySet(), values(), and entrySet(). The entrySet() method returns a Set view of the key-value pairs in the map, which can be used to iterate over the pairs and modify the map as you go. . | Thread safety: HashMap is not thread-safe, which means that if multiple threads access the same HashMap instance concurrently and at least one thread modifies the map structurally, the behavior is undefined. To make a HashMap thread-safe, you can use the ConcurrentHashMap class instead, which provides concurrent access and is designed for high concurrency. In a Full Stack project it would be best to use a NoSQL database to avoid concurrency issues. . | public class Pet { // Instance data private final String name; private final int age; private final String color; /* constructor * */ public Pet(String name, int age, String color) { this.name = name; this.age = age; this.color = color; } public String getName() { return this.name; } public int getAge() { return this.age; } public String getColor() { return this.color; } } . import java.util.HashMap; public class Pets { // create a new HashMap HashMap&lt;String, Pet&gt; names = new HashMap&lt;&gt;(); /* Add Pets * */ public Pets() { // add some key-value pairs to the HashMap names.put(&quot;Leo&quot;, new Pet(&quot;Lion&quot;, 8, &quot;Gold&quot;)); names.put(&quot;Porky&quot;, new Pet(&quot;Pig&quot;, 3, &quot;Pink&quot;)); names.put(&quot;Ro-Ro&quot;, new Pet(&quot;Robin&quot;, 7, &quot;Red&quot;)); names.put(&quot;Midnight&quot;, new Pet(&quot;Cat&quot;, 10, &quot;Black&quot;)); names.put(&quot;Hobbes&quot;, new Pet(&quot;Kitty&quot;, 1, &quot;Calico&quot;)); names.put(&quot;Duke&quot;, new Pet(&quot;Dog&quot;, 14, &quot;Brown&quot;)); } /* Remove Pet * */ public Pet remove(String key) { // check if a key exists in the HashMap then remove Pet pet = null; if (names.containsKey(key)) { pet = names.get(key); names.remove(key); } return pet; } /* Print Pets * */ public void print() { // iterate over the keys in the HashMap for (String name: names.keySet()) { Pet obj = names.get(name); System.out.println(name + &quot; is a &quot; + obj.getColor() + &quot; &quot; + obj.getName() + &quot; and is &quot; + obj.getAge() + &quot; years old.&quot;); } System.out.println(); } /* Tester Method * */ public static void main(String[] args) { // intialize Pets Pets pets = new Pets(); pets.print(); // remove a Pet String key = &quot;Hobbes&quot;; Pet pet = pets.remove(key); if (pet == null) { System.out.println(key + &quot; not found&quot;); } else { System.out.println(&quot;Removed: &quot; + key + &quot;, &quot; + pet); } pets.print(); } } Pets.main(null); .

Below is an example using a java.util.Set and listed are some key things to consider when using this data structure. A Set works similarly to a key in a HashMap, a Set is just the Key. . No duplicates: A Set does not allow duplicate elements. If you try to add an element that already exists in the Set, the add() method will return false and the Set will not be modified. Duplicate add is shown in example. . | Unordered: A Set does not maintain the insertion order of elements. The order of elements in a Set may change as elements are added or removed. . | Equality: Two Sets are considered equal if they have the same elements, regardless of their order. The equals() method is used to test for Set equality. . | Implementation classes: Java provides several implementation classes for the Set interface, including HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet. Each implementation has different performance characteristics and is optimized for different use cases. . | Iterator: The iterator() method can be used to iterate over the elements in a Set. The order in which elements are returned by the iterator is not defined and may change over time as elements are added or removed from the Set. The forEach() method is another way to iterate over the elements in a Set, and it allows you to pass a lambda expression to process each element in the Set. Lambda expression is shown in example. . | import java.util.HashSet; import java.util.Set; public class petset { public static void main(String[] args) { // create a new HashSet Set&lt;String&gt; pets = new HashSet&lt;&gt;(); // add some elements to the Set pets.add(&quot;lion&quot;); pets.add(&quot;dog&quot;); pets.add(&quot;cat&quot;); // print out the Set System.out.println(pets); // check if an element is in the Set boolean hasLion = pets.contains(&quot;lion&quot;); System.out.println(&quot;Has lion: &quot; + hasLion); // remove an element from the Set pets.remove(&quot;lion&quot;); System.out.println(&quot;Removed lion&quot;); // print out the Set System.out.println(pets); // add duplicate System.out.println(&quot;add duplicate dog&quot;); pets.add(&quot;dog&quot;); // no action System.out.println(pets); // add duplicate System.out.println(&quot;add pig&quot;); pets.add(&quot;pig&quot;); System.out.println(pets); // using forEach() method with a lambda expression pets.forEach(animal -&gt; { String message = &quot;I &quot;; // ternary operation for like, don&#39;t like message += animal.equals(&quot;dog&quot;) ? &quot;like&quot; : &quot;don&#39;t like&quot;; // complete sentance message += &quot; &quot; + animal + &quot;s &quot; + &quot;for pets&quot;; System.out.println(message); }); } } petset.main(null); .

I gained weight, became lazy, and spent nearly all of my time slumped over my computer,” says Rosner, who played up to 18 hours a day, every day, for nearly two years. “When you become one of the top players in a game like World of Warcraft, tens of thousands of players are essentially under you, so you become like a virtual god” | For Rosner, gaming was detrimental. His grades suffered, he missed assignments, and he almost failed to complete his first year of college. After turning away from the game, Rosner found other sources of pleasure. He joined a gym, started DJing at his university, and became much more active socially. “I couldn’t believe what I had been missing,” he says. Ironically, World of Warcraft led Rosner to achieve his dream of making films. His documentary, IRL — In Real Life, chronicles his adventures and how he learned to break free from gaming. More than 1 million people worldwide have viewed his film, which can be seen on YouTube. It has been featured at film festivals, on TV, and in newspapers and magazines. | . | Automated telephone trees were designed to save employers money, but also reduce hold time for customers.

            "content": "The Code . JWT | SecurityConfig | . Simple Explanation of each java file . A majority of the code was taken from https://www.javainuse.com/spring/boot-jwt. The new dependencies we need is in this Commit. This site provided the basic code needed to generate a jwt token and how we would configure the backend to require authorization when accessing a page. (Commit1 &amp; Commit2). . JwtTokenUtil.java, just like its name, contains utilities/functions that is needed to generate JWT tokens and get information like the email from the JWT tokens which is needed for making sure the JWT token is valid. . JWTUserDetailsService.java implements the Spring Security UserDetailsService interface and overrides the loadUserByUsername so we can later get user details from the database using the username. . The name JwtAuthenticationController.java on the article was changed to JwtApiController.java to fit the already existing API controllers and this creates an API endpoint of /authenticate which validates that the given email and password in the body is validate and then generates a JWT token for the credentials if it was valid. . We did not need the JwtRequest.java because it is used to store each user as an object and that is the Person class we’ve already coded. We also do not need JwtResponse.java. . The JwtRequestFilter.java extends the Spring Web Filter OncePerRequestFilter class and overrides the doFilterInternal function so each request sent to the server is processed through the function. The function checks if the JWT token is valid and sets the Authentication in the context to specify that the current user is authenticated. . JwtAuthenticationEntryPoint.java implements AuthenticationEntryPoint and overrides the commence function to specify what to do when a user was not authenticated, which is to return an unauthorized error. . WebSecurityConfig.java is our existing SecurityConfig.java. It extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter and overrides configure to allow /authenticate to not need the request be authenticated because /authenticate is where you generate the JWT token is get authenticated, add the jwtRequestFilter.java filter to validate the token with every request, and configure other features of web security like a stateless session. This can also be used to allow specific roles when that is configured (as seen in last year’s csa project). . Bigger changes differing from the article . JWTUserDetailsService.java was changed from the article because we already have a database storing users while the article hardcoded a user and password because it did not. . In the article, it assumed that our passwords stored inside the database was already encrypted using bcrypt, therefore, we have to configure /post to encrypt the passwords when adding users (Commit). . Since the article coded for /authenticate to return the JWT token inside its body, the frontend would have to take the JWT token and configure it into the browser. This would be susceptible to Cross Site Scripting Attacks. We can avoid forcing the frontend’s javascript to set the cookie by coding for /authenticate api’s response to automatically set the browser’s cookies with the JWT token using the Set-Cookie header. For this part, I followed along with https://reflectoring.io/spring-boot-cookies/ and made some changes to JwtApiController.java. Now the request sent by the browser would contain the JWT token using a HttpOnly cookie, so we have to code JwtRequestFilter.java so it gets the JWT token from the request’s Cookie header instead of its Authorization header (Commit). . Testing . Postman Testing . Using the existing account’s credentials test2@gmail.com and test2 to generate JWT Token through /authenticate. . Trying to access /api/person/ without jwt token stored in Cookies . Trying to access /api/person/ with a wrong jwt token stored in Cookies . Trying to access /api/person/ with a jwt token that does not have the signature . Accessing /api/person/ with generated jwt token stored in Cookies header . Testing the use of cookies in Chrome console . At first, when you access http://localhost:8085/, it will return a 401 Unauthorized error because you do not have a jwt cookie. We can use Chrome console with fetch to model what a frontend would do, set data = {email:&quot;toby@gmail.com&quot;, password:&quot;123Toby!&quot;}; then fetch(&quot;http://localhost:8085/authenticate&quot;, {method: &#39;POST&#39;, headers: {&#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;}, body: JSON.stringify(data)});: Notice how we have a jwt cookie now Reload and http://localhost:8085/ should load without 401 error .

Because many of your user’s important info like name, email, and dob may be leaked. Accidently leaking info can make people to stray away from using your website. Let’s try to not let that happen. . Basic Knowledge . HTTP: a communication protocol to deliver data over the internet . The client makes a request (ex: POST, GET), server consults database and returns an output | . Database: collection of information that is organized, where the server can quickly query data and add/delete data .

Big Boy exploits . SQL Injection . Before you read anything about SQL Injection, make sure you understand everything in the “Basic Knowledge” section . Definition . SQL injection is a type of web application vulnerability that occurs when an attacker maliciously inserts or “injects” unauthorized SQL code into a database query. It takes advantage of improper handling of user-supplied input, typically in a web application that interacts with a database using SQL queries. . Confused? Here is an example: . Example . Let’s say you want to buy a gift on Amazon and go to this link https://amazon.com/products?category=Gifts . This causes the SQL query to retrieve details from the database . SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = ‘Gifts’ AND released = 1 . Where . “*” = everything | Products = table name | The restricts are that the category is ‘Gifts’ and released is equal to 1 (in this example this means the gift is released) | . Now what if we want to get stuff from the database that isn’t released? How would we bypass the “released=1”? . This is where SQL injection comes into play! Before we tackle how to do it, let’s go over some syntax . Syntax . Two dashes (- -) is an SQL comment | ” |   | ” is concatenate | . | SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ‘william’ AND password = ‘Password1!’ Stuff between single quotes are strings | Everything else is an SQL query | . | . IMPORTANT . A single quote (‘) helps you break out of a string and write more SQL query! | “AND” statement always runs before “OR” statement | . Now we are getting into the good stuff . How the attack works . Remember that a login page uses a sql query to search the db if the user and password entered is correct. Remember this syntax: SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ‘william’ AND password = ‘Password1!’ Whatever you enter into the login page will be set as “username” and “password”. My syntax examples has username as ‘william’ and password as ‘Password1!’. Notice how they are between single quotes. Anything between quotes is a string and everything outside of it is a SQL query. . But what if you enter a single quote ‘ into the login page? Then you will break out of the string and be able to run SQL queries! This is the basis of the two payloads below: . OR Payload: Having an OR statement that is always true | . Let’s say we enter admin’ OR ‘1’=’1’ for the username field. Then our sql query will look like this: SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ‘admin’’ OR ‘1’=’1’ AND password = ‘Password1!’ . Now remember how a single quote ‘ will break out of a string and run sql query commands. We are basically running OR ‘1’=’1’ which will obviously always evaulate as true. And since a OR statement will be true if one side of the argument is true, we basically bypass both the username and the password. Thus both fields could be incorrect but we would still be able to login! . Comment Payload: Commenting parts of the query in order to bypass stuff | . Remember how two dashes (–) is an SQL comment? Well we can abuse this to bypass some info. . For example, we can bypass the password by inputting admin’– in the username box. The sql query would be: SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ‘admin’’– AND password = ‘Password1!’ . This will lead to the AND password section not being executed. Thus we don’t need to input the correct password in order to login. In fact, we don’t even need to input a username as sql validates it as an empty string and the whole expression would take the first user. So uh you won’t need to have either info. . How to protect . Learning how the exploits are cool and all but the whole point of this blog is to learn how to protect your website. Here is one way you can protect against sql injections . Use of Prepared Statements (with Parameterized Queries) . Instead of directly embedding user-supplied data in SQL queries, prepared statements use placeholders for the input data. The SQL statement and the input data are sent separately to the database, preventing malicious input from altering the structure of the query. | . Here’s an example of not protected code: . import java.sql.*; public class DatabaseExample { // Assuming you have established a database connection // Without any protection measures public static void createUser(String username, String password) { String sql = &quot;INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES (&#39;&quot; + username + &quot;&#39;, &#39;&quot; + password + &quot;&#39;)&quot;; try (Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(&quot;jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/db_name&quot;, &quot;username&quot;, &quot;password&quot;); Statement statement = connection.createStatement()) { statement.executeUpdate(sql); } catch (SQLException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } public static void main(String[] args) { // Example usage String username = &quot;john&quot;; String password = &quot;secretpassword&#39;; DROP TABLE users; --&quot;; createUser(username, password); } } . With protection . import java.sql.*; public class DatabaseExample { // Assuming you have established a database connection // Option 1: Use of Prepared Statements (with Parameterized Queries) public static void createUser(String username, String password) { String sql = &quot;INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES (?, ?)&quot;; try (Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(&quot;jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/db_name&quot;, &quot;username&quot;, &quot;password&quot;); PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(sql)) { statement.setString(1, username); statement.setString(2, password); statement.executeUpdate(); } catch (SQLException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } public static void main(String[] args) { // Example usage String username = &quot;john&quot;; String password = &quot;secretpassword&quot;; createUser(username, password); } } . In this example, we have a createUser method that takes username and password as parameters. We define a SQL query string with placeholders (?) for the values. . Inside the method, we establish a connection to the database using JDBC. We then create a prepared statement using the SQL query string. The setString method is used to set the values for the placeholders. . Finally, we execute the update using executeUpdate to insert the user into the database. Any potential SQL injection attempts are prevented because the parameterized queries ensure that the user input is treated as data and not as part of the SQL syntax. . There are a lot more ways to protect against sql injection. Feel free to research them: . Use of Properly Constructed Stored Procedures . | Allow-list Input Validation . | Escaping All User Supplied Input . | . XSS (Cross Site Scripting) . The use of sending JavaScript that can be executed in the browser. Can modify the page, send more HTTP requests, and access cookies. . Basically some websites are dumb and think &lt; script&gt; is still html . Why should we care? Well JS is powerful. It can modify the html through the DOM, note down user inputs, and even read website cookies. It has the power and potential to do basiclaly anything, making it very crucial to protect against it. Here is a real life example of the exploit in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GtbY1XWGlQ&amp;t=0s . Types . Reflected XSS: user input is identified as html but it’s now and it’s reflected back. For example if you input “&lt; script&gt;alert(“bruh”)&lt; /script&gt; into a text box and send a GET request, the alert JS will be run. | Stored XSS: same as reflected xss but instead of being reflected back to the user, it’s stored in the db. The user it then affected by the modified db. This is even more dangerous than reflected xss because it injects everyone who views the injected page! | . How to fix . You might think it’s a simple removing the ability to input script tags but it’s not because event handlers exist. Filtering ‘&lt;’ and ‘&gt;’ techincally works but could cause other problems. . So how do you actually fix? You could simply use a library called DOMPurify that filters everything for you :D . How to use DOMPurify . Note . Most of my knowledge from this blog came from my experience completing web exploit ctf (capture the flag) problems. This is just skimming the surface of web vulnerabilities but I hope it makes you more mindful of your website’s security.

            "content": "Understanding the Internet . The internet is a vast network of interconnected computers and devices that allows for the exchange of information and communication on a global scale. It is a fundamental part of modern life, influencing the way we work, socialize, and access information. Let’s explore how the internet works and its key functionalities. . How the Internet Works . 1. Network Infrastructure: . The internet is a network of networks, comprised of millions of devices connected through various technologies such as cables, fiber optics, and wireless connections. | The internet is decentralized, meaning that there is no central authority that controls it. Instead, it is made up of many smaller networks that are connected to each other. This allows for greater flexibility and resilience in the face of disasters or attacks. | . 2. Protocols: . Communication on the internet relies on protocols, which are standardized sets of rules that govern data transmission. For example, HTTP is used for web browsing. | Protocols are used to ensure that data is transmitted reliably and efficiently. They also allow for interoperability between different devices and networks. For example, HTTP allows web browsers to communicate with web servers. This means that you can access any website from any device as long as it supports HTTP. This is why you can use your phone to browse the internet even though it doesn’t have a keyboard or mouse. HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP that encrypts data before sending it over the network. This prevents eavesdroppers from intercepting sensitive information such as passwords or credit card numbers. There are many other versions of HTTP, each with its own purpose and features. | . GET /index.html HTTP/1.1 Host: www.example.com . IP Addresses: . Every device connected to the internet is assigned a unique identifier called an IP address. This address helps in routing data to the correct destination. www.example.com -&gt; 192.168.1.1 This is similar to how your home address is used to deliver mail to your house. IP addresses are typically represented in a 32-bit format, with each 8-bit segment separated by a period. However, with the growth of the internet, the number of available IP addresses is running out. To solve this problem, a new standard called IPv6 was introduced, which uses a 128-bit format. . Popcorn Hack 1 . Log into your AWS account. Which type of ip address is used in the AWS server? . Data Packets &amp; Transfering: . Information is broken down into small packets for efficient transmission. These packets travel independently across the network and are reassembled at their destination. There are many examples on how data sends their packets but the most common one is messaging with your friends. . Data packets are like letters that are sent through the mail. They contain information about the sender, recipient, and contents of the letter. Similarly, data packets contain information about the source and destination of the data, as well as the data itself. This allows for efficient transmission of information over the internet. An example of a data packet is shown below: . . Bandwith . Bandwith measures how fast data sends to the recipent. Think about cars, they go in miles per hour, but in this case, as we are talking about computers, we measure this in bits per second. In a car the slower the miles per hour, the slower the car. Same logic applies here as well, when the bandwith is lower, the data takes a longer time to send resulting in lag. . Routing . Routing in simple terms is the path in which the sender sends a message and the router helps give a “route” to the sender through a series of packets. Without a router, packets cannot be sent and devices won’t be able to communicate with each other. . Popcorn Hack . . Brief Overview into Domains and Subdomains . Domain name: For example in https://docs.google.com/, google is the domain name Subdomain name: In the same example as above, docs is the subdomain name. . Protocols and Transfering of Data (Briefly Explained) . . The OSI Model consists of 7 steps in which devices communicate with each other. Each step contains its own different steps and going over them will take a long time, so review over them after the lesson is over. . In the Narrow Waist, there are 4 layers in which devices communicate with each other. . The Network Access Layer there is a connection between a hardware device (ethernet and others) and its connected to a physical device like a computer in order to send packets and information that way. . The Internet Layer, is the layer which is built off the Network Access Layer in which packets are sent via the IP addresses. These packets contain metadata in which there is information stored inside. (Routers also play a role!) . Internet Scalability: Based on what we learned, the internet is very scalable, its able to send information (via packets) to many devices which are all part of a LAN or Local Area Network. These LANs are part of a router in which the intranet is. LANs can also exchange information with each other. . TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): . Reliable Delivery: TCP makes sure that data sent between devices arrives safely and in the right order. . Connection Setup: Before sending data, TCP sets up a connection between devices. . Checks and Corrections: It double-checks to confirm data is sent and received correctly. If anything gets lost, it sends it again. . Efficiency: It controls how fast data moves so that a fast sender doesn’t overwhelm a slow receiver. . TCP guarantees the safe and ordered delivery of data, similar to a registered mail service. It’s often used for applications like web browsing, email, file transfer, and etc. . UDP (User Datagram Protocol): Not So Safe Delivery: UDP doesn’t promise that your data will arrive or be in the right order. . No Handshake: It doesn’t say “hello” before sending data; it just shoots out the packets without checking if they reached the other side. . Less Checking: It doesn’t spend time correcting errors like TCP does, which makes it faster. . Speed Matters: UDP is used in things like online games, live videos, and voice calls where being fast matters more than making sure every piece of data gets there perfectly. . Think of UDP as a protocol that’s akin to sending a postcard; it’s fast and efficient, but there’s no confirmation that the postcard arrived at its destination, and it might get lost or arrive out of order. . DNS (Domain Name System) Internet Phone Book: DNS is like an internet directory that matches human-readable website names (like “google.com”) to their actual computer-friendly addresses called IP addresses (like “192.168.1.1”). . Translation Service: It translates website names into IP addresses so devices can find and connect to the correct websites or services on the internet. Routing Requests: When you type a website name in a browser, DNS helps your device locate the right server by providing the IP address associated with that name. . Simplifying Access: Instead of remembering complicated strings of numbers, DNS makes it easier for people to access websites using simple and memorable names. . Wrap-Up / Popcorn Hack . Information Retrieval: . The internet serves as a vast repository of information. Search engines like Google help users find relevant content by indexing and ranking web pages. Question: How does a search engine determine the relevance of web pages? . Entertainment: . Streaming services for music, movies, and games provide entertainment options, accessible to users at any time. Question: Briefly explain how streaming services deliver content to users in real-time. . Collaboration: . Tools like Google Docs and cloud storage services facilitate collaboration, allowing individuals and teams to work on projects together, regardless of location. Question: How does cloud storage ensure data availability and accessibility? . Conclusion . In summary, the internet is a dynamic and ever-evolving network that plays a crucial role in our daily lives. Understanding its basic components and functionalities is essential for navigating the digital landscape effectively. .",

Multiple connections, in reference to a computing device, could be considered “Fault Tolerant”. Building “Fault Tolerant” systems makes the network or internet stronger. . Understanding Computer, Routers, Systems, and Purpose are a pre-requisite to understanding Fault Tolerance systems. Regarding College Board videos, for clarification, a Router is typically used to connect computers. Here is an illustration that is very similar to the key components we have used in this class and should be familiar to those who have done deployment. | . As we are at school, using an HTTP client we request a page via LAN or Campus Network. This Network has a router and an ISP router that directs us to the public internet. | DNS is used to translate https://nighthawkcodingsociety.com to an IP address, see What’s My DNS | This targets the Web Server, the request is directed through a router to the Server running Nginx, which intern directs request to Gunicorn application hosting the Flask Website. | . Fault tolerant “routing” and “systems” on the internet is achieved by having redundancy in routing paths and computer functions. Networks and Systems become stronger because of many routes and redundancy of function. This AWS picture shows load balancing, multiple zones, redundant equipment, standby and fail over equipment and paths. This is much more than just having multiple connections, there is A LOT of planning in making fault tolerance. This is why there is such a rise in companies like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc. | . . The path the TCP/IP packet will follow might be different from other packets, for instance from the same HTTP communication. The routers in the network are responsible for the right addressing, depending on traffic volume, errors in the network, etc. Since the Internet is Fault Tolerant, there are many paths to a destination, similar to Google Maps providing alternate paths when we travel. Time can be seen with Ping. Routes and time can be see with TraceRoute command… | .

View/Blog Concepts . A notes/blog would be created to add Notes between students and teacher, part of original concept. Notes could be used for many types of applications. Details on creating notes will be part of another blog, but for now we want you to think about design. . In this design, most recent messages are on top | Messages are intended to support markdown and inclusion of images | Think about technique to format images in conjunction with Text | . . Hacks . Build and correlate a technical design between frontend view and backend model. This blog is focussing on frontend view., and visual concepts on how CRUD operations are presented to user of system. This particular Jupyter Notebook and code within it are used to help establish technical ideas. Start a design for your project… . Each project must have a View (as pictured) and Model (json data is fetched into the View). Describe your project. | Describe your View. Use Markdown, HTML, UML, other visuals, tables are used to characterize a project. This shows the Teacher and Graders understanding of planning Model and View. | Transition from pure design and start inserting code elements, like inputs. Also, try build a table with json data versus fetching data. | Issues should discuss problems/challenges, in Teacher/Student data here are a couple … This design will have many JavaScript actions, at least one for each CRUD operation. In this design, developer needs think of JavaScript functions to replace placeholder alerts in example code above. | There can be different roles for CRUD operations. For instance, student will only interact with their own account. Teacher may interact with many accounts. | Given these CRUD operations what kind of APIs are needed? They should map closely button/on click actions, as each action will fetch or manipulate data differently. | . | . Extra Credit. Student(s) could assist in rework of my Flask project from last year into a Frontend / Backend solution.

The layouts/base.html is structural beginning file for index.html, greet.html, birds.html or any future file added to this project. This connection is made at the top of each HTML template, layout:decorate=”~{layouts/base}”. . As you look at the contents of the layouts/base.html think of it as the structure and common contents that will be in every HTML file. As you look back at the index.html, consider that it is starting with layouts/base.html and inserting its page specific fragments for the head and body. . Thymeleaf will put all these things together through a pre-process step.

Resources Overview . . Resources are structure in standard directories for many reasons: familiarity amongst developer, tool defaults, deployment defaults, cache optimizations, etc. Here are some of introductions: . static/images - this is where a web server typically expects images that do not change after deployment. Service in deployment will cache these files for quick loading over the internet. | static/sccs - these are cached as well. This location and the sccs name state this will work with node tools. The standard is called Sassy and is the same as used in Python Flask projects. | templates/error - error pages can be placed here. Can you guess were you would put a 500 error page. | application.properties - this resource is used to define defaults for the application. Most of these default are used by backed, for instance this will be used to define location of a database. This is similar to __init__.py. | . .",

Layouts Notes from Midnight Theme . If you’d like to change the theme’s HTML layout: . For some changes such as a custom favicon, you can add custom files in your local _includes folder. The files provided with the theme provide a starting point and are included by the original layout template. | For more extensive changes, copy the original template from the theme’s repository(Pro-tip: click “raw” to make copying easier) | Create a file called /_layouts/default.html in your site | Paste the default layout content copied in the first step | Customize the layout as you’d like | Welcome to SASS . SASS helps process a SASS file and compile it like the usual CSS file. Using SASS let’s us leverage off of a lot of implementation that has already been performed, such as GitHub pages. But it also lets you more programmatically build CSS. . . SASS Prerequisites . Skip downloads section unless you have issues. . Downloads / Command Prompt Lines . Check for npm --version to verify install, or download node.js here (just download the LTS version). . | This line of code is just used to check that you actually have npm installed, if not run installer : . | . npm --version . Next you will use check for sass : | . npm view sass version . Install sass if required : | . npm install -g sass . SASS Tips . Features / Functionality . As the great thing about scss is that it writes the css for you, making it much less tedious. There are many aspects as to why it actually simplifies the process. | . Aspect 1: Partials . Sass naturally transpiles all the .scss files directly. However, when you want to import a file, you do not need the file to be transpiled directly. Sass has a mechanism for this: If you start the filename with an underscore, Sass will not transpile it. Files named this way are called partials and they allow you to work in a much more organized space. | . Aspect 2: Defining Colors / Variables . Rather than retyping the hexadecimal values of each color every single time, you can define all of the ones you want to use in a partial and then just reference them with $[color] when you want to use it. However, make sure you import the partial into the scss file where you are going to use it in. | . $light: #f7f7f7; $dark: #222121; $lime: #00cc66; $orangeRed: #fb4b4e; $blue: #2541b2; . Example shown here: | . .navbar { background: $light; // see how instead of having to retype the hexadecimal, I can just reference it like this WOWOW so COOL height: 80px; display: flex; justify-content: space-between; padding: 0.5rem calc((100vw - 1200px) / 2); z-index: 10; position: relative; . Aspect 3: Nested Styling . Another unique aspect about scss is that you can actually nest styles, so if you want an aspect like let’s say color to apply to everything you are working on for that portion of the html, you can actually nest the rest of the formatting, animations, etc within that definition. | Implementation shown here with the Hero section in student scss: | . .hero { background-color: $light; // see how the rest of the code is indented / nested within .hero &amp;__container { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; align-items: center; justify-items: center; margin: 0 auto; height: 90vh; z-index: 1; width: 100%; max-width: 1200px; padding-right: 24px; padding-left: 24px; @include tablet { // @include tablet and @include mobile will be explained next grid-template-columns: 1fr; height: 100%; } &amp;--left { width: 100%; line-height: 1.2; @include tablet { padding: 5rem 0; } @include mobile { line-height: 1.5; } } &amp;--left h1 { font-size: 4rem; color: $lime; @include mobile { font-size: 1.5rem; } } &amp;--left h2 { font-size: 4rem; color: $dark; @include mobile { font-size: 2rem; } } &amp;--left p { font-size: 2rem; color: $dark; margin-top: 1rem; font-weight: 700; @include mobile { font-size: 1.5rem; } } &amp;--btn { font-size: 1rem; background-color: $lime; padding: 14px 32px; border: none; border-radius: 4px; color: $light; margin-top: 2rem; cursor: pointer; position: relative; transition: all 0.3s; outline: none; } &amp;--btn a { position: relative; z-index: 2; color: $light; text-decoration: none; } &amp;--btn:after { // code animates home page button so that it transitions to red when hovered position: absolute; content: &#39;&#39;; top: 0; left: 0; width: 0; height: 100%; background: $orangeRed; transition: all 0.3s; border-radius: 4px; } &amp;--btn:hover:after { width: 100%; } &amp;--right { text-align: center; } &amp;--img { height: 100%; width: 100%; } } } . You can see how this code works in tandem with the Hero section of the HTML, the class definitions are associated with every definition of styling coded above: | . &lt;!-- Hero HTML, each of the classes here correspond to what&#39;s defined above in the scss &lt;div class=&quot;hero&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;hero__container&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;hero__container--left&quot;&gt; &lt;h1&gt;College Apps Are Coming!&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Be Prepared&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sign up now to join the list.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;button class=&quot;hero__container--btn&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Sign Up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;hero__container--right&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;images/img-2.svg&quot; class=&quot;hero__container--img&quot; /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; --&gt; . Aspect 4: Easily Change Formatting Based on Device . With the power of scss, you can more easily than ever change the formatting of your site based on which device a person is using. | Such can be done by defining the resolutions in a partial like here: | . &lt;!-- @mixin tablet { @media screen and (max-width: 768px) { @content; } } @mixin mobile { @media screen and (max-width: 280px) { @content; } } --&gt; . Then you can use @include to reference these resolutions and change the css/formatting based on the device like here: | . &amp;--left h1 { font-size: 4rem; color: $lime; @include mobile { // in this case the font size changes because it&#39;s mobile font-size: 1.5rem; } } &amp;--left h2 { font-size: 4rem; color: $dark; @include mobile { font-size: 2rem; } } . Aspect 5: Extending, Inheritance, and Calculations . In scss, you can also use @extend if you want certain classes to inherit attributes from previously defined classes, sort of similar to nesting inheritance (where the classes nested within inherit the attributes from outermost classes). An example is shown below: | . &lt;!-- %align-center { display: flex; align-items: center; } logo { color: $dark; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: none; font-size: 2rem; margin-left: 24px; @extend %align-center; //it&#39;s inheriting the above values for display and align:items } --&gt; . Furthermore, you can actually use math operators like multiplication, addition, subtraction and division in scss. In the code below I use it to extend the animation of a button: | . &amp;--btn:hover:after { width: 100% * 4; //makes the animation extend way farther, past the border of the button } .

            "title": "JWT Project",
            "content": "JWT Project . Link for Repository’s . Frontend | Backend | . . Frontend . Login.html ( Login.html ) . The Login.html has a lot of styling and html due to there being a fucntional register and login in one html file. Let’s Break it down: . HTML Section : This part of the file is responsible for setting up the structure of the webpage. The HTML section of this file starts from the &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; declaration and extends till the closing &lt;/body&gt; tag. . It defines two main sections, Login and SignUp, enclosed within div tags with id attributes set as ‘login’ and ‘signup’ respectively. Each of these sections includes a combination of images and input fields to make up the form for user login and signup. | Input fields for username and password are provided along with corresponding images for better user experience. | . | . . . JavaScript Section : This section is responsible for the functionality of the webpage, i.e., what happens when a user interacts with the page. Lets Break it down: It includes functions to handle user authentication with the auth function, user registration (createUser function), and switching between login and signup views (switchPage function). | The auth function makes a POST request to a the backend deployed URL which has all the endpoints, with the user’s entered username and password. If the authentication is successful, the user is redirected to ‘/index.html’ succesfully, with a token. | The createUser function similarly makes a POST request to create a new user when a user registers, and if successful, the user is logged in automatically, and the log in is saved for future uses. | There are also a number of functions responsible for adjusting the layout based on the window size for a responsive design and switching between the login and register on the same page. | . | The include env.js which will inject the content of env.js at that point in the HTML file before the server sends it to the client. This is a way to provide dynamic content in the HTML file before it is sent to the client. | Env.js Contains: const api = [‘localhost’, ‘127.0.0.1’].includes(window.location.hostname) ? “http://localhost:8570” : “https://nighthawkguessr.duckdns.org”; and this is used with the fetch function to fetch from either local host or from depoloyed backend link. This is a very crucial part of the code | . . Index html . This page is the home page of the website and is locked untill you login succesfully and have a token. Javascript Part is the only thing playing a role in JWT in the index.html so here it is: . JavaScript Section JavaScript functions are defined to handle various interactions on the page, such as authenticating a login, signing out, updating difficulty, redirecting to the game page, and handling UI changes when a difficulty option is selected. | An asynchronous function authenticateLogin fetches the user’s authentication status from the server and makes the webpage content visible only if the user is authenticated. If the authentication fails, the user is redirected to the login page. | The signOut function clears all cookies and reloads the page, effectively signing the user out. | Other functions like updateDifficulty, resetScoreCookie, and gameRedirect are used to manage the game’s difficulty level and user scores. | The resize function adjusts the positions, text sizes, and image sizes of various elements on the page depending on the window size, ensuring that the webpage is responsive to different screen sizes. | . | The nclude env.js which will inject the content of env.js at that point in the HTML file before the server sends it to the client. This is a way to provide dynamic content in the HTML file before it is sent to the client. | Env.js Contains: const api = [‘localhost’, ‘127.0.0.1’].includes(window.location.hostname) ? “http://localhost:8570” : “https://nighthawkguessr.duckdns.org”; and this is used with the fetch function to fetch from either local host or from depoloyed backend link. This is a crucial part of the code | . . Backend . Jwt File (JWT_Auth.py) . (Most Important File) . The jwt_auth.py script is a part of my backend application that is responsible for managing JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), which are used for user authentication. This module provides functions for user registration and authentication, and also includes a route that provides information on the current user’s authentication status. . breakdown of the different components of the jwt_auth.py script: . Authentication Function: The authenticate(username, password) function is used to authenticate users. This function looks in the database for a user with the given username, and if such a user is found, it checks if the provided password, when hashed, matches the stored hashed password for that user. If the password is correct, the function returns the User object; otherwise, it returns None. . | Identity Function: The identity(payload) function retrieves a user based on the identity payload of a JWT. This payload contains a user’s ID, and the function queries the database to find and return the user with this ID. . | . | JWT Routes: routes under the jwt_auth blueprint: . /auth_status: This GET route returns the username of the currently authenticated user, verifying the functionality of the JWT. . | /register: This POST route registers a new user. It first validates the request data to ensure a username and password are provided. Then, it checks the database to make sure a user with the provided username doesn’t already exist. If the username is available, it hashes the password using bcrypt, creates a new User object, adds it to the database session, commits the session to save the new user in the database, and finally sends a response indicating that the new user was successfully created. . | . | . Creating Database File (DB_Create.py &amp; User.py) . db_create.py: . The db_create.py script is responsible for setting up the database structure for my application. It’s one of the first steps taken in the lifecycle of my application, even before you can start registering users or performing any other actions. The crucial functionality it performs is calling db.create_all(), which is an SQLAlchemy command that looks at all of the classes that inherit from db.Model and creates corresponding tables in the database. . | In the context of JWT registration, db_create.py is the script that creates the user table in the database, where user data will be stored. Without this table, you would have no place to store or retrieve user details, so user registration (and subsequent authentication) would not be possible. . | . | Let’s now move to user.py: . user.py file defines the User model class. This class is a representation of the user table in the database. Each instance of this class corresponds to a row in the user table. It consists of three columns - id, username, and password. . | id is a unique identifier for each user. | username is a string that stores the username of a user. It has been set as non-nullable and unique which means each user must have a username and that username must be unique. | password is a string that stores the hashed password of a user. It’s non-nullable meaning every user must have a password. | When a new user registers, the register() function in jwt_auth.py creates a new instance of the User class, filling in the username and hashed password provided by the user. It then adds this new user to the database. | . | . In the authentication process, the User model is used to look in the database for a user with a specific username or ID. This is essential in both the authenticate() function, which checks the submitted password against the stored hashed password for a username, and the identity() function, which retrieves a user based on their ID as stored in the JWT. . Init.py Files . The init.py files in my application play an essential role in managing and facilitating dependencies among the modules. . nighthawkguessr_api/init.py: This file mainly sets up the Flask application and its dependencies. In the context of JWT registration, it creates an instance of Flask and configures it to use a SQLite database. Additionally, it sets a secret key, which is critical for creating and verifying JWTs, and it prepares the SQLAlchemy object (db), which manages database interactions. The db object is later imported in the user model (User) and in the authentication routes (jwt_auth.py) to query and persist user information in the database. . | nighthawkguessr_api/model/init.py: This file is essentially the entry point for my models, and its primary role is to make the importing of different models simpler and more streamlined. In other words, instead of importing models individually from each file, you can import all at once from the model package. This is useful when multiple parts of the application need to access these models. Regarding JWT registration, the User model imported in this file is critical, as it is used in the jwt_auth.py file to handle user data during registration and authentication. . | . Main.py . In my Flask application, the main.py script plays a crucial role in JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication. JWT is a compact, self-contained method for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. The information is verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA. . | In the application, the jwt_auth.py file defines the authenticate and identity methods which are integral to the JWT authentication process. These two functions are utilized in main.py to set up JWT for the Flask app. . The authenticate function, defined in jwt_auth.py, takes in a username and password as parameters and authenticates the user. It checks if the user exists in the database and whether the provided password matches the stored (hashed) password for the user. If the credentials are correct, it returns the user object. This function is used during the generation of a JWT when a user logs in. . | The identity function, also defined in jwt_auth.py, takes the payload of a JWT as a parameter and extracts the user id from it. It then retrieves the user associated with this id from the database and returns the user object. This function is used to get the current user (who claims to own the token) when a JWT is provided in a request to a protected endpoint. . | . | In the main.py script, these two functions are given as arguments to the JWT constructor, establishing a JWT object: . jwt = JWT(app, jwt_auth.authenticate, jwt_auth.identity) This line is crucial as it sets up JWT handling in my Flask app. It uses jwt_auth.authenticate for authenticating users when they log in, and jwt_auth.identity for identifying users from incoming JWTs in requests to protected routes. . | Another crucial part of the main.py is cors = CORS(app, origins=re.compile(“.*”), supports_credentials=True) This line enables CORS and the supports_credentials = True is extremely important because it allows cookies or authenticated requests to be made cross origins. . | . | . Requirements.txt . -e file:./vendor/flask-jwt#egg=Flask-JWT . This line in requirements.txt is installing the Flask-JWT package from a local directory (./vendor/flask-jwt) in editable mode. This way, I am not dependent on the version available on PyPI or any changes made by the maintainers of the original package. . . AWS Deployment . Nginx Changes . . .",

Call 1: Midpoint calculated as (0 + 10) / 2 = 5 The target value 12 is greater than the midpoint value at index 5 (10). So, we narrow our search to values greater than the midpoint. . Call 2: recBinarySearch(intArray, mid1, high, target) Midpoint 1 calculated as (mid + high) / 2 = 7 . The midpoint value at index 7 is 14, which is greater than 12, so the next call is between low and mid. .

Recursive Version . public class Recursion5 { public static void recursionCount(int n) { if (n &lt;= 0){ System.out.println(&quot;done&quot;); } else { System.out.println(n); recursionCount(n - 1); // recursive function } } public static void main(String[] args) { recursionCount(3); // initial call } } Recursion5.main(null); . 3 2 1 done . Iterative Version . public class Iteration { public static void iterationCount(int n) { for (int i = n; i &gt;= 1; i--) { // using a for loop to iterate, notice we go only so i is greater than 1 and not 0 System.out.println(i); } System.out.println(&quot;done&quot;); } public static void main(String[] args) { iterationCount(3); // same initial call } } Iteration.main(null); . 3 2 1 done . Popcorn Hacks: We we go only so i is greater than or equal to 1 and not 0. Why? . Traversing With Recursion . You can traverse many things with recursion. Here I will show traversal through a string, array, and an ArrayList object. . String Traversal . You can traverse through a string, finding a specific character in the string. . public class FindChar { public static boolean findChar(String s, char target, int index) { if (index &gt;= s.length()) { // checks for if the index we are looking for is greater than the word length return false; } if (s.charAt(index) == target) { // checks for if there is a character the index we are searching return true; } return findChar(s, target, index + 1); // recalls method, recursion } public static void main(String[] args) { String sampleString = &quot;words&quot;; // example string char targetChar = &#39;s&#39;; // character we are looking for System.out.println(&quot;Sample String: &quot; + sampleString); boolean isCharFound = findChar(sampleString, targetChar, 0); // checks if the character we are looking for is found, based on boolean if (isCharFound) { System.out.println(&quot;Character &#39;&quot; + targetChar + &quot;&#39; is found.&quot;); // if it is found, show this } else { System.out.println(&quot;Character &#39;&quot; + targetChar + &quot;&#39; is not found.&quot;); // if not show this } } } FindChar.main(null); . Sample String: words Character &#39;s&#39; is found. . You can also find and print a certain range of characters from the string. . public class PrintRange { public static void printRange(String s, int startIndex, int endIndex) { if (startIndex &lt; 0 || endIndex &gt; s.length() || startIndex &gt;= endIndex) { // checks for invalid declaration or end (negative index, index larger than string length, index start has reached the end) return; } System.out.print(s.charAt(startIndex)); // print the characters in the range printRange(s, startIndex + 1, endIndex); // recursive calling } public static void main(String[] args) { String sampleString = &quot;example&quot;; // string int startIndex = 0; int endIndex = 5; System.out.println(&quot;Word: &quot; + sampleString); System.out.println(&quot;Start: &quot; + startIndex + &quot;, End: &quot; + endIndex); System.out.print(&quot;Characters in the specified range: &quot;); printRange(sampleString, startIndex, endIndex); // initial call } } PrintRange.main(null); . Word: example Start: 0, End: 5 Characters in the specified range: examp . Popcorn Hack: Make it so that we can find two different ranges and print them. . // Enter code here . Array Traversal . You can also traverse arrays using recursion. . public class ArrayTraversal { public static int findIndex(int[] arr, int targetIndex, int currentIndex) { if (currentIndex &lt; 0 || currentIndex &gt;= arr.length) { // checks for invalid (index less than 0, index greater than array length) return -1; // returns invalid } if (currentIndex == targetIndex) { // if the index is found return currentIndex; } return findIndex(arr, targetIndex, currentIndex + 1); // recursion } public static void main(String[] args) { int[] sampleArray = {1, 4, 6, 8, 4, 9, 12}; int targetIndex = 2; // target int foundIndex = findIndex(sampleArray, targetIndex, 0); if (foundIndex != -1) { // checks what has been outputted int value = sampleArray[foundIndex]; // found index value System.out.println(&quot;Index &quot; + targetIndex + &quot; is found in the array at position &quot; + foundIndex + &quot; with a value of &quot; + value); // found } else { System.out.println(&quot;Index &quot; + targetIndex + &quot; is not found in the array.&quot;); // not found } } } ArrayTraversal.main(null); . Index 2 is found in the array at position 2 with a value of 6 . ArrayList Object Traversal . We can also traverse the ArrayList object. . import java.util.ArrayList; public class ArrayListTraversal { public static int findIndex(ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; list, int targetIndex, int currentIndex) { if (currentIndex &lt; 0 || currentIndex &gt;= list.size()) { // checks for invalid return -1; } if (currentIndex == targetIndex) { // finds index return currentIndex; } return findIndex(list, targetIndex, currentIndex + 1); // recusion } public static void main(String[] args) { ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; sampleList = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); // created ArrayList object sampleList.add(1); sampleList.add(4); sampleList.add(6); sampleList.add(8); sampleList.add(4); sampleList.add(9); sampleList.add(12); int targetIndex = 2; // target int foundIndex = findIndex(sampleList, targetIndex, 0); if (foundIndex != -1) { // checks for if found or not int value = sampleList.get(foundIndex); // gets found index from ArrayList object System.out.println(&quot;Index &quot; + targetIndex + &quot; is found in the ArrayList at position &quot; + foundIndex + &quot; with a value of &quot; + value); } else { System.out.println(&quot;Index &quot; + targetIndex + &quot; is not found in the ArrayList.&quot;); } } } ArrayListTraversal.main(null); . Index 2 is found in the ArrayList at position 2 with a value of 6 . Conclusion . Must Knows: . How to create recursive code (recalling a method within itself, with parameters that change) | Record progression through recursion (completing certain tasks through the progression) | Traversal of strings, arrays, and the ArrayList object | . Overall, recursion is useful as an alternative to iteration. Recursion is usually chosen for problems that can naturally be divided into parts, like sorting which will be talked about in the next part. . 10.2 Binary Search . Binary Search vs Linear Search . target number - 24 . intArray - 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 . Popcorn hack: . How many times iterated through for Linear Search? . Answer: . Example of Binary Search with Recursion . public class BinarySearch { public static void main(String[] args) { int[] intArray = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40}; // Example array int target = 24; // Example target value int result = recBinarySearch(intArray, 0, intArray.length - 1, target); if (result == -1) { System.out.println(&quot;Target not found in the array.&quot;); } else { System.out.println(&quot;Target found at index: &quot; + result); } } public static int recBinarySearch(int[] intArray, int lowPosition, int highPosition, int target) { //method if (lowPosition &gt; highPosition) { return -1; // Element not found in the array } else { int midPosition = (lowPosition + highPosition) / 2; if (intArray[midPosition] &lt; target) { return recBinarySearch(intArray, midPosition + 1, highPosition, target); } else if (intArray[midPosition] &gt; target) { return recBinarySearch(intArray, lowPosition, midPosition - 1, target); } else { return midPosition; // Element found at midPosition } } } } BinarySearch.main(null); . Target found at index: 12 . Call 1 . Index = 0 - 20, midPosition = 10, midPosition value = 20 . Since 24 &gt; 20, . then… . lowPosition = midPosition + 1 = 11 highPosition = highPosition = 20 . Call 2 . Index = 11-20, midPosition index = 15, midPosition value = 30 . Since 24 &lt; 30, . then… . lowPosition = lowPosition = 11 high position = midPosition - 1 = 14 . Call 3 . Index = 11-14, midPosition index = 12, midPosition value = 24 . Since 24 = 24, . then… . return midPosition; . In total, our recursive calls to the method 3 times. . Recursive Logic behind Merge Sort . What is Merge Sort? Merge sort is a recursive sorting algorithm that can be used to sort elements in an array or ArrayList . Follows a divide and conquer approach | . . Notes: . List: [38,27,43,3,9,82,10] sudocode version: mergeSort(List) { mergeSort(left) mergeSort(right) merge(left &amp; right) } . Must finish call above it in order to finish the call | . Call 1: . Splitting List into half | Left side: [38, 27, 43, 3] | Must finish call 1 in order to do the right side and do the merge | Recursively calls mergesort and splits the list in half again | Call 2: . New Left side List: [38, 27] | Method calls are stacking on top of each other | . Notes: . Element 5 can’t be split into the left or the right, nor can it be merged with itself | Consider the left call complete! | . Notes: . Same thing applies with the right, element 25 can’t be split to the left or the right, nor can it merge with itself. | Now we will merge them back in order: [5, 25] | Important concepts: . When making new recursive call, we are NOT making a new list, array, or a new set of elements. | Basically updating all the way back to the original list | . Notes: . When merging back together, it will merge back from least to greatest. | . Popcorn Hack: What will the final list be? . Answer: . The mergeSort Method . //sudocode mergeSort(myArray, low, high) { if (low &lt; high) { middle = (low + high)/2; //find middle mergeSort(myArray, low, middle); //make a recursive call from low to middle (look at left hand side) mergeSort(myArray, middle + 1, high); //once low is no longer less than high, make a new recursive call (look at right hand side) merge (myArray, low, middle, high); //merge back together } } . int [] myArray = {3, 4, 6, 8, 1, 2, 5, 7}; . Steps: . Split the Array in half | Left side: {3, 4, 6, 8}; Right side {1, 2, 5, 7}; | . Compare the first indexes in each individual array (which would be index 0 and index 4) | . . Since 1&lt;3, our new index 0 value would be 1 when we merge the array back together | . . Since 5&gt;3, our new index 2 value would be 3 when we merge the array back together | Popcorn Hack: What will the final array return? . Answer: {} . Wait, but there’s an issue… . . . After comparing index 3 and index 7, we then need to compare index 3 and index, but there is no index 8… | Will recieve an index out of bounds exception. | . No worries! Since we are done with the sort, we can just move the rest of the elements to the end of the array because we are already done sorting. . Index 3 will now become index 7. . Hacks . Create a 2D array either with just a regular array variable that you can recursively traverse through. | Each value in this 2D array must be a string that you can individually traverse through. | You must output a result of all string values that have a user inputted letter. | . import java.util.Scanner; public class String2DArrayTraversal { public static void main(String[] args) { // code in here } public static void traverseString2DArray(String[][] array, char letter, int row, int col) { // code in here } } String2DArrayTraversal.main(null); .

The java code for it: . class Mom{ // CODE } class Son extends Mom{ // CODE } class Daughter extends Mom{ // CODE } . In this example, the Son and Daughter inherits the Mom, meaning it inherit the components of the mother. This makes the “Son” and “Daughter” classes the __ of the “Mom” class as they inherit the “Mom” class components and the “Mom” class the ___. . 9.2 Using the Super keyword for Constructors .

Method overriding is a concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. This enables a subclass to provide its own behavior for a method while maintaining a relationship with its superclass. . In the context Java, here’s how method overriding works: . Inheritance: Method overriding is closely related to inheritance. You have a superclass (or base class) and a subclass (or derived class). The subclass inherits properties and behaviors from the superclass. . Superclass Method: The superclass defines a method. This method can be overridden by the subclass. . Subclass Overrides: In the subclass, you can provide a new implementation of the same method. This is done by using the same method name, return type, and parameter list. . @Override Annotation (Java): In Java, it’s common to use the @Override annotation to explicitly indicate that a method in the subclass is intended to override a method in the superclass. This helps catch errors during compilation if the method doesn’t correctly match the superclass method signature. . Why Override Methods: . Method overriding is used for several reasons: . Customization: It allows you to customize or extend the behavior of a superclass method in the subclass to meet the specific needs of the subclass. . Polymorphism: Method overriding is a key component of polymorphism. It enables you to treat objects of the subclass as if they were objects of the superclass, promoting flexibility and extensibility. . Consistency: Method overriding helps maintain a consistent interface for classes in an inheritance hierarchy. Code that uses the superclass doesn’t need to be changed when a subclass overrides a method. . Code Reusability: It promotes code reusability by allowing you to build on existing code in the superclass. . class Animal { void makeSound() { System.out.println(&quot;Animals make sounds&quot;); } } class Dog extends Animal { @Override void makeSound() { System.out.println(&quot;Dog barks&quot;); } } class Cat extends Animal { @Override void makeSound() { System.out.println(&quot;Cat meows&quot;); } } public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { Animal animal = new Animal(); Animal dog = new Dog(); Animal cat = new Cat(); animal.makeSound(); // Output: Animals make sounds dog.makeSound(); // Output: Dog barks cat.makeSound(); // Output: Cat meows } } Main.main(null); . Animals make sounds Dog barks Cat meows . In this example: . We have a base class Animal with a method makeSound(). . We create two subclasses, Dog and Cat, which inherit from the Animal class. . Both Dog and Cat classes override the makeSound() method with their own implementations. . In the main method, we create instances of the base class and its subclasses. . We demonstrate polymorphism by calling the makeSound() method on objects of the base class and the subclasses. The method called depends on the actual type of the object, not the reference type. . This showcases how method overriding allows you to provide specific implementations for methods in subclasses, promoting polymorphism and custom behavior for each subclass. . Another Example: . &lt;img class=”image” src=”https://github.com/AniCricKet/musical-guacamole/assets/91163802/576237f9-cdc4-409b-84f9-96dffe0cdd5c” width=32%&gt; &lt;img class=”image” src=”https://github.com/AniCricKet/musical-guacamole/assets/91163802/03923e22-2b6e-4e4d-9244-1d5145f6c6d9” width=32%&gt; &lt;img class=”image” src=”https://github.com/AniCricKet/musical-guacamole/assets/91163802/5fe0c72c-c17b-4edb-a567-8c9098998aac” width=32%&gt; . Imagine you’re building a program to manage sports team rosters. You can have a base class ‘Athlete’ representing common attributes and actions of all athletes. Then, create subclasses for specific sports like ‘FootballPlayer’, ‘BasketballPlayer’, and ‘SoccerPlayer’. . // Base Class class Athlete { String name; int age; int jerseyNumber; String position; public Athlete(String name, int age, int jerseyNumber, String position) { this.name = name; this.age = age; this.jerseyNumber = jerseyNumber; this.position = position; } public void train() { System.out.println(name + &quot; is training.&quot;); } public void displayInfo() { System.out.println(&quot;Athlete Info:&quot;); System.out.println(&quot;Name: &quot; + name); System.out.println(&quot;Age: &quot; + age); System.out.println(&quot;Jersey Number: &quot; + jerseyNumber); System.out.println(&quot;Position: &quot; + position); } } Athlete athlete = new Athlete(&quot;John Mortensen&quot;, 19, 4, &quot;Teacher&quot;); athlete.train(); athlete.displayInfo(); . John Mortensen is training. Athlete Info: Name: John Mortensen Age: 19 Jersey Number: 4 Position: Teacher . class FootballPlayer extends Athlete { public FootballPlayer(String name, int age, int jerseyNumber, String position) { super(name, age, jerseyNumber, position); } @Override public void train() { System.out.println(name + &quot; is practicing football drills.&quot;); } @Override public void displayInfo() { super.displayInfo(); } } class BasketballPlayer extends Athlete { public BasketballPlayer(String name, int age, int jerseyNumber, String position) { super(name, age, jerseyNumber, position); } @Override public void train() { System.out.println(name + &quot; is shooting 3s on the court.&quot;); } @Override public void displayInfo() { super.displayInfo(); } } class SoccerPlayer extends Athlete { public SoccerPlayer(String name, int age, int jerseyNumber, String position) { super(name, age, jerseyNumber, position); } @Override public void train() { System.out.println(name + &quot; is practicing taking free kicks.&quot;); } @Override public void displayInfo() { super.displayInfo(); } } . FootballPlayer footballPlayer = new FootballPlayer(&quot;Tyreek Hill&quot;, 28, 10, &quot;Wide Receiver&quot;); BasketballPlayer basketballPlayer = new BasketballPlayer(&quot;Jimmy Butler&quot;, 32, 22, &quot;Small Forward&quot;); SoccerPlayer soccerPlayer = new SoccerPlayer(&quot;Neymar Jr&quot;, 31, 10, &quot;Left Winger&quot;); footballPlayer.train(); footballPlayer.displayInfo(); System.out.println(); basketballPlayer.train(); basketballPlayer.displayInfo(); System.out.println(); soccerPlayer.train(); soccerPlayer.displayInfo(); System.out.println(); . Tyreek Hill is practicing football drills. Athlete Info: Name: Tyreek Hill Age: 28 Jersey Number: 10 Position: Wide Receiver Jimmy Butler is shooting 3s on the court. Athlete Info: Name: Jimmy Butler Age: 32 Jersey Number: 22 Position: Small Forward Neymar Jr is practicing taking free kicks. Athlete Info: Name: Neymar Jr Age: 31 Jersey Number: 10 Position: Left Winger . Explanation: . In this Java code, you have a basic “Athlete” class with information and actions that all athletes share. Then, there are specific types of athletes (football, basketball, and soccer players) that inherit these common traits but also have their unique behaviors, like training routines. Method overriding lets them have their own way of training while keeping the shared information, making the code easy to manage and reuse for different types of athletes. . Popcorn Hack: . Why is it helpful to have a common base class like ‘Athlete’ for all these different types of athletes? How does it make the code more organized? . 9.4 Using Super keyword for Methods . Why only use super for constructors when you can use them for methods too? | With the super key word, not only can you store variables, but also store methods | . class Animal{ public void Introduction(String name){ System.out.println(&quot;I am a &quot; + name); } } class Dog extends Animal{ public void Woof(){ super.Introduction(&quot;Dog&quot;);//Inherits the introduction method in the Animal Class, then introduces itself as a dog System.out.println(&quot;Woof!&quot;); //Does its own thing } } class Cow extends Animal{ public void Moo(){ super.Introduction(&quot;Cow&quot;);//Inherits the introduction method in the Animal Class, then introduces itself as a cow System.out.println(&quot;MOOOO!&quot;);//Does its own thing } } class Test{ public static void main(String[] args){ Dog dog = new Dog(); Cow cow = new Cow(); dog.Woof(); cow.Moo(); } } Test.main(null); . I am a Dog Woof! I am a Cow MOOOO! . 9.4 Hack . Finish up the code with this criteria: All subclasses must say their origin, the origin can be from SchoolSupply class, and it must run through main. . class SchoolSupply{ public void BasicInfo(){ //Code } } class Pencil extends SchoolSupply{ public void Information(){ //Code } } class Eraser extends SchoolSupply{ public void Information(){ //Code } } public class Test{ public static void main(String[] args){ //Code } } . 9.5 Creating References Using Inheritance Hierarchies . Inheritance can be thought as an upside down tree with the __ on the top and the __ on the bottom. The __ is the superclass while the __ are the subclasses of this superclass. A visual representation of this tree is called a type diagram or hierarchy tree. . A sample structure would be like: . public class A public class B extends A public class C extends B public class D extends C public class E extends I public class F extends I public class G extends H public class H extends A public class I extends H . Popcorn Hack . Draw a hierarchy tree for the above structure and add the picture here | . This structure works as C not only inherits properties from B, but it also inherits properties from A. B is like C’s parent and A is like C’s grandparent. Think about it like real life, all families inherit something from their ancestors. . In addition, you could also create objects like this: . C c = new C(); B c = new C(); A c = new C(); . // This is the above example in code form class A {} class B extends A {} class C extends B {} public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { C c = new C(); // variable c is of type C B b = new C(); // variable b is of type B, but refers to an instance of C A a = new C(); // variable a is of type A, but refers to an instance of C } } . 9.6 Polymorphism . A _____ variable is polymorphic when it can refer to objects from different classes at different points in time . A reference variable can store a reference to its declared class or any subclass of it’s declared class | . A method or operator are considered polymorphic when they are ____ in at least one subclass . Polymorphism is the act of executing an overridden non-_____ method from the correct class at runtime based on the actual object type . Polymorphism allows __ for a method call to be executed based on the class of the object referenced instead of the declared class . Example 1 . Java polymorphism is mainly split into 2 types . R_____ . Process in which a function call to the overridden method is resolved at Runtime. This type of polymorphism is achieved by Method Overriding. | . C_____ . Also known as static polymorphism. This type is achieved by function overloading or operater overloading | Note: But java doesnt support Operator Overloading | When there are multiple functions with the same name but different parameters then these functions are said to be overloaded. Functions can be overloaded by changes in the number of arguments or/and a change in the type of arguments. | . Here is an example of compile polymorphism . // Class 1 // Helper class class Helper { // Method 1 // Multiplication of 2 numbers static int Multiply(int a, int b) { // Return product return a * b; } // Method 2 // // Multiplication of 3 numbers static int Multiply(int a, int b, int c) { // Return product return a * b * c; } } // Class 2 // Main class class GFG { // Main driver method public static void main(String[] args) { // Calling method by passing // input as in arguments System.out.println(Helper.Multiply(2, 4)); System.out.println(Helper.Multiply(2, 7, 3)); } } GFG.main(null) . 8 42 . Example 2 &amp; Popcorn Hack . Before executing cell, look at the example below. Think about which methods compiles? Which methods execute? . import java.util.Random; public class Entertainer{ private String talent; public Entertainer (String t){ talent = t; } public String getTalent(){ return talent; } } public class Comedian extends Entertainer{ private ArrayList&lt;String&gt; jokes; public Comedian(String t, ArrayList&lt;String&gt; jks){ super(t); jokes = jks; } public String getTalent(){ return &quot;Comedy style: &quot; + super.getTalent(); } public String tellJoke(){ return jokes.get((int)(Math.random()*jokes.size())); } } // Which one of these will run? Which one of these will not? Comment out the line that isn&#39;t working and explain why Entertainer kevin = new Entertainer(&quot;Musician&quot;); System.out.println(kevin.getTalent()); System.out.println(kevin.tellJoke()); ArrayList&lt;String&gt; oneLiners = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;(); //Add code which adds jokes to oneLiners like... Why did the programmer quit his job?.. Why did the developer go broke?.. Entertainer soham = new Comedian(“satire”, oneliners); System.out.println(soham.getTalent()); System.out.println(((Comedian)soham).tellJoke()); . Example 3 . Here is an example of runtime polymorphism . // Class 1 // Helper class class Parent { // Method of parent class void Print() { // Print statement System.out.println(&quot;parent class&quot;); } } // Class 2 // Helper class class subclass1 extends Parent { // Method void Print() { System.out.println(&quot;subclass1&quot;); } } // Class 3 // Helper class class subclass2 extends Parent { // Method void Print() { // Print statement System.out.println(&quot;subclass2&quot;); } } // Class 4 // Main class class GFG { // Main driver method public static void main(String[] args) { // Creating object of class 1 Parent a; // Now we will be calling print methods // inside main() method a = new subclass1(); a.Print(); a = new subclass2(); a.Print(); } } GFG.main(null) . subclass1 subclass2 . 9.7 Object Superclass . Now that we have learned about inheritance, what even allows our classes and objects that we have created to work the way they do? Where do the general characteristics of all objects come from? The answer lies in the __ class. . The __ class is the superclass of all other classes as well as arrays and other data types. The Object class is part of the java.lang package. . When we call a constructor to a “top-level class” that the coder hasn’t declared a superclass for, the Object constructor is implicitly called. In other words, the Object constructor is implicitly called when we call a constructor in a class that doesn’t explicitly extend another class. This will give the object some properties and methods that are common to all classes. . Example 1 . public class Person { String name; int age; public Person(String name, int age) { this.name = name; this.age = age; } public static void main(String[] args) { Person person1 = new Person(&quot;Jane Doe&quot;, 30); Person person2 = new Person(&quot;Jane Doe&quot;, 30); System.out.println(person1.equals(person1)); // Since person1 and person1 are the same object, the equals() method will return true System.out.println(person1.equals(person2)); // Since person1 and person2 are different objects, the equals() method will return false even though they have the same contents } } Person.main(null); // The equals() method is inherited from the Object class // By default, the equals() method in the Object class checks for object identity, which means it compares memory addresses to see if two references point to the exact same object // In the code, person1 and person2 are distinct objects, so they have different memory addresses // When we call person1.equals(person2), it checks if the memory addresses are the same (which they are not), so it returns false. . true false . Example 2 . public class Book { String title; String author; public Book(String title, String author) { this.title = title; this.author = author; } public static void main(String[] args) { Book book = new Book(&quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;, &quot;J.D. Salinger&quot;); int hashCode = book.hashCode(); System.out.println(&quot;HashCode: &quot; + hashCode); // The output will be a unique integer value representing the object&#39;s hash code. The integer value will be different every time you run it } } Book.main(null); // The hashCode() method in the Object class returns a unique integer value for each object // This value is typically based on the object&#39;s memory address. // In the code, when we call book.hashCode(), it generates a unique integer value representing the book object // This value can be useful for various purposes, such as organizing objects in collections like HashMaps or HashSet where it helps in efficient retrieval of objects. .

            "content": "9.1 Superclasses and Subclasses . A hierarchy of classes is created, extending attributes into subclasses of information (ie. Automobile –&gt; Trucks and Sedans –&gt; Ford, BMW, Nissan, Toyota). . Pre-Requisites . Before we start you need to remember what classes and methods are. Scopes of variables are also important to this section because you need to know which classes can access which variables before extending a variable across classes. . Scope of Variables: . Variables can be declared as private or public. . Popcorn Hack: What are scope do private and public variables allow? . Private Public . only directly accessible within the class they are declared | accessible anywhere inside and outside their class | . These are different types of variables. Only INSTANCE and STATIC variables can be declared as __ or __. . Variable Type Definition Scope within Class Scope to Subclasses .   | variables within methods | cannot be accessed outside method | cannot be accessed outside class | .   | variables within a class but not inside a method | can be accessed in entire class | can be accessed in subclasses | .   | variables that belong to a class, not instance | can be accessed in entire class | can be accessed in subclasses | .   | variables specific in passing values to the method | cannot be accessed outside method | do not affect inheritance | . Now we can go into class hierarchies. . Class Hierarchy . Definitions . Superclasses - a class that contains all the common __ and __ that could be shared among other classes (a blueprint for subclasses) | Subclasses - extends the __ to is specified by a superclass; can also have additional specific attributes | “Is-A” Relationship - the relationship when a subclass __ a superclass (ie. Automobile –&gt; Sedan; a Sedan “is-a” automobile) | . extends Keyword . extends the __ from the __ . class Automobile { public String brand; // public instance var private String model; // private instance var public Automobile(String brand, String model) { this.brand = brand; this.model = model; } public void start() { System.out.println(&quot;Car is starting&quot;); } } class Truck extends Automobile { public int cargoCapacity; // subclass specific var // instance that is specific to the Truck subclass, with vars from Automobile class public Truck(String brand, String model, int cargoCapacity) { super(brand, model); // inherited vars this.cargoCapacity = cargoCapacity; } // specific method to Truck public void loadCargo() { System.out.println(&quot;Loading cargo into the truck&quot;); } } class Sedan extends Automobile { public boolean isLuxury; // subclass specific var // instance that is specific to the Sedan subclass, with vars from Automobile class public Sedan(String brand, String model, boolean isLuxury) { super(brand, model); // inherited vars this.isLuxury = isLuxury; } // specific method to Sedan public void accelerate() { System.out.println(&quot;Sedan is accelerating&quot;); } } public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { Automobile car = new Automobile(&quot;Toyota&quot;, &quot;Camry&quot;); Truck truck = new Truck(&quot;Ford&quot;, &quot;F-150&quot;, 1000); Sedan sedan = new Sedan(&quot;BMW&quot;, &quot;328i&quot;, true); // automobile methods and variables System.out.println(car.brand); // Accessing public variable // System.out.println(car.model); // compilation error because of the private var car.start(); // truck methods and variables System.out.println(truck.brand); // inherited public var System.out.println(truck.cargoCapacity); // public var specific to truck truck.loadCargo(); // sedan methods and variables System.out.println(sedan.brand); // inherited public var System.out.println(sedan.isLuxury); // public var specific to sedan sedan.accelerate(); } } Main.main(null); . Toyota Car is starting Ford 1000 Loading cargo into the truck BMW true Sedan is accelerating . This example shows how the Automobile class is extended twice, with the Truck and Sedan subclasses. . Popcorn Hack: If I were to declare a variable color that is private in the class Automobile, would I be able to extend and directly access that variable to the subclass Truck or Sedan? . A: No, you would need to encapsulate the private variable as shown above, through a method in the superclass and then inherit that var with super(), which will be explained later. . 9.2 Writing Constructors for Subclasses . Learning Objectives . Constructors are not inherited | When a subclass’s constructor doesn’t explicitly call a superclass’s constructor using super, Java inserts a call to the superclass’s no-argument constructor. | The actual parameters passed in the call to the superclass constructor provide values that the constructor can use to initialize the object’s instance variables. | Regardless of whether the superclass constructor is called implicitly or explicitly, the process of calling superclass constructors continues until the Object constructor is called. At this point, all of the constructors within the hierarchy execute beginning with the Object constructor. | . Important note: Constructors are NOT inherited by the subclass. See this in action below. . // TO BE INCLUDED EARLIER IN THE LESSON. IT IS NECESSARY FOR THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THIS SECTION. class Vehicle { public int year; public String manufacturer; public Vehicle(int year, String manufacturer) { // constructor for parent class this.year = year; this.manufacturer = manufacturer; } public Vehicle() { this.year = 2000; this.manufacturer = &quot;Unknown&quot;; } // method to be used later public void drive() { System.out.println(&quot;The driver is driving the car.&quot;); } } . class Car extends Vehicle { public String model; public Car(String model) { this.model = model; } } public class VehicleDemonstration { public static void main(String[] args) { Car myCar = new Car(&quot;Altima&quot;); System.out.println(&quot;Year: &quot; + myCar.year); System.out.println(&quot;Manufacturer: &quot; + myCar.manufacturer); System.out.println(&quot;Model: &quot; + myCar.model); } } VehicleDemonstration.main(null); . Year: 2000 Manufacturer: Unknown Model: Altima . As you can see, the output uses the no-argument construction info from the base Vehicle constructor. . The super keyword can be used to change parent constructor values. . class NewCar extends Vehicle { public String model; public NewCar(int year, String manufacturer, String model) { super(year, manufacturer); // see the use of super here // what happens if you use no arguments with super()? see reminders below this.model = model; } } public class VehicleDemonstration2 { public static void main(String[] args) { NewCar myCar = new NewCar(2016, &quot;Nissan&quot;, &quot;Altima&quot;); System.out.println(&quot;Year: &quot; + myCar.year); System.out.println(&quot;Manufacturer: &quot; + myCar.manufacturer); System.out.println(&quot;Model: &quot; + myCar.model); } } VehicleDemonstration2.main(null); . Year: 2016 Manufacturer: Nissan Model: Altima . Key Reminders: . If you do call super() in your constructor, it has to be the first line of the constructor. | You cannot assign values to parent attributes/variables without using super(). | If you call super() with no arguments, it will use the no-argument parent constructor. This also happens automatically if you don’t include any super() call. | 9.3 Overriding Methods . Learning Objectives . Method overriding occurs when a public method in a subclass has the same method signature as a public method in the superclass. | Any method that is called must be defined within its own class or its superclass. | A subclass is usually designed to have modified (overwritten) or additional methods or instance variables. | A subclass will inherit all public methods from the superclass; these methods remain public in the subclass. | . There are three options for methods to be used by subclasses: . Methods inherited from the parent class | Unique methods written for the subclass | Override parent methods to modify its implementation | The first two should make sense. Let’s see an example of overriding parent methods below. . public class NuroCar extends Vehicle { private String deliveryItem; // unique constructor public NuroCar(int year, String manufacturer, String deliveryItem) { super(year, manufacturer); // another use of super this.deliveryItem = deliveryItem; } // HERE is the overridden function public void drive() { System.out.println(&quot;This car is driving itself!&quot;); } } public class VehicleDemonstration3 { public static void main(String[] args) { NuroCar pizzaCar = new NuroCar(2023, &quot;Nuro&quot;, &quot;Pizza&quot;); // here&#39;s the call to the overridden function pizzaCar.drive(); } } VehicleDemonstration3.main(null); . This car is driving itself! . This can be very helpful if you want a certain parent method to function slightly differently for a certain subclass. . Popcorn Hack . A parent class Animal is often used to show how subclasses can differ from their parent classes. An Animal parent class is provided in the cell below. Create a subclass of a certain species that overrides a parent method and uses `super` to call to the parent&#39;s constructor while adding its own unique attributes. . Hint: See Hint . Not all animals &quot;run&quot; like the `move()` function says... // parent class public class Animal { private String species; private int milesPerHour; // no argument constructor public Animal() { this.species = &quot;Unknown&quot;; this.milesPerHour = 10; } // constructor with arguments public Animal(String species, int milesPerHour) { this.species = species; this.milesPerHour = milesPerHour; } // parent method public void move() { System.out.println(&quot;The &quot; + this.species.toLowerCase() + &quot; runs at &quot; + this.milesPerHour + &quot; miles per hour.&quot;); } } // your subclass goes here . 9.4 Super Keyword . Using the super keyword to call a superclass’s method. . public class Performer { //superclass public void practice(){ System.out.println(&quot;Honing my craft!&quot;); } public void perform(){ System.out.println(&quot;Performing for an audience!&quot;); } } public class Dancer extends Performer { //subclass public void perform(){ System.out.println(&quot;Dancing on the stage!&quot;); } } public class BalletDancer extends Dancer { //subclass public void jete(){ System.out.println(&quot;Leaping...&quot;); } public void pirouette(){ System.out.println(&quot;Spinning...&quot;); } public void perform(){ jete(); pirouette(); } public static void main(String[] args){ BalletDancer derrick = new BalletDancer(); derrick.practice(); derrick.perform(); } } System.out.println(&quot;BalletDancer class: &quot;); BalletDancer.main(null); . BalletDancer class: Honing my craft! Leaping... Spinning... . public class Performer { //superclass of Dancer class public void practice(){ System.out.println(&quot;Honing my craft!&quot;); } public void perform(){ System.out.println(&quot;Performing for an audience!&quot;); } } public class Dancer extends Performer { //superclass of BalletDancer class public void perform(){ System.out.println(&quot;Dancing on the stage!&quot;); } } public class BalletDancer extends Dancer { public void jete(){ System.out.println(&quot;Leaping...&quot;); } public void pirouette(){ System.out.println(&quot;Spinning...&quot;); } public void perform(){ perform();//Why is this wrong? jete(); pirouette(); } public static void main(String[] args){ BalletDancer derrick = new BalletDancer(); derrick.practice(); derrick.perform(); } } System.out.println(&quot;BalletDancer class: &quot;); BalletDancer.main(null); . Note: . Super keyword can be placed in any order as it prints out chronologically. . public void perform(){ super.perform(); jete(); pirouette(); } . &quot;Honing my craft! Dancing on the stage! Leaping... Spinning...&quot; . However, if we were to write: . public void perform(){ jete(); pirouette(); super.perform(); } . &quot;Honing my craft! Leaping... Spinning... Dancing on the stage!&quot; . What if we use 2 super keywords? . public class Performer { //superclass public void practice(){ System.out.println(&quot;Honing my craft!&quot;); } public void perform(){ System.out.println(&quot;Performing for an audience!&quot;); } } public class Dancer extends Performer { //subclass public void perform(){ super.perform(); System.out.println(&quot;Dancing on the stage!&quot;); } } public class BalletDancer extends Dancer { //subclass public void jete(){ System.out.println(&quot;Leaping...&quot;); } public void pirouette(){ System.out.println(&quot;Spinning...&quot;); } public void perform(){ super.perform(); jete(); pirouette(); } public static void main(String[] args){ BalletDancer derrick = new BalletDancer(); derrick.practice(); derrick.perform(); } } System.out.println(&quot;BalletDancer class: &quot;); BalletDancer.main(null); . BalletDancer class: Honing my craft! Performing for an audience! Dancing on the stage! Leaping... Spinning... . Popcorn Hack . Create a subclass and a superclass by calling the methods from the superclass from the subclass using the keyword super. . // place code here . 9.5 Creating References Using Inheritance Hierarchies . Inheritance Hierarchies is the idea that: . If we have a public superclass (A) that then has a public subclass (B) and that public subclass then has another public subclass (C), then the subclass C is also a subclass of the superclass A and so subclass C is extending superclass A | . Here is an example of this: . // Class Declarations: // Superclass (A) public class Vehicles{} // Subclass (B) public class Car extends Vehicles{} // Subclass (C) public class Sedan extends Car{} // Subclass (D) public class Truck extends Vehicles{} . Here is a diagram displaying this relationship: . . This diagram shows the the vehicle superclass which then has two subclasses: Car and Truck, however, Car has another subclass called Sedan . | Based on this diagram, we know that Truck has a “is-a” relationship with Vehicle, Car also has a “is-a” relationship with Vehicle, and since Car has an “is-a” relationship with Vehicle, so does Sedan . | So Sedan also has a “is-a” relationship with Vehicle . | . If we assume that all of the class contain a constructor with no arguments, this then allows for us to declare a superclass reference variable to hold a subclass object: . Vehicles v1 = new Truck(); Vehicles v2 = new Car(); // instead of doing Car v3 = new Sedan(); // We have the option to do this instead Vehicles v4 = new Sedan(); . However, it is important to remember that you can’t declare a Subclass variable and put in a Superclass object . // don&#39;t do this Sedan v5 = new Vehicle(); . Popcorn Hack: Using a superclass and subclasses of your choice, assuming that the classes contain a constructor with no arguments, create Class Declarations and Superclass References . // show here . Why would we want to do this? . When doing object oriented programming, we are able to create a superclass with common attributes and then have subclasses with more specific traits . | By doing this, we get rid of code redundancy and it also makes the easier to reuse common aspects without needing to write them out every time while still presenting the option to override any attribute from the superclass to better represent the subclass . | All the subclasses adhere to one superclass so this makes updates to code much easier and allows you to take advantage of polymorphism to unify the code and allow for more flexible and manageable code (more about this in 9.6) . | . Here is a Complete Example of the Inheritance Hierarchy from above: . class Vehicle { private String brand; // private instance variable private int year; // private instance variable public Vehicle(String brand, int year) { this.brand = brand; this.year = year; } public void displayInfo() { // common variables for each vehicle System.out.println(&quot;Brand: &quot; + brand); System.out.println(&quot;Year: &quot; + year); } } class Truck extends Vehicle { // feature that only a truck can have private double maxLoadCapacity; public Truck(String brand, int year, double maxLoadCapacity) { super(brand, year); // Inherits the variables from superclass this.maxLoadCapacity = maxLoadCapacity; } @Override // Override allows for displayInfo to now also show the trait specific to the Truck while still keeping the main variables public void displayInfo() { super.displayInfo(); // Reuse the displayInfo method from the superclass System.out.println(&quot;Max Load Capacity: &quot; + maxLoadCapacity + &quot; tons&quot;); } } class Car extends Vehicle { // something that cars have private int numberOfDoors; public Car(String brand, int year, int numberOfDoors) { super(brand, year); this.numberOfDoors = numberOfDoors; } @Override // Override allows for displayInfo to now also show the trait specific to the Car while still keeping the main variables public void displayInfo() { super.displayInfo(); // Reuse the displayInfo method from the superclass System.out.println(&quot;Number of Doors: &quot; + numberOfDoors); } } class Sedan extends Car { // Sedan is luxury so trait specific to sedan private boolean leatherSeats; public Sedan(String brand, int year, int numberOfDoors, boolean leatherSeats) { super(brand, year, numberOfDoors); this.leatherSeats = leatherSeats; } @Override // Override allows for displayInfo to now also show the trait specific to the Sedan while still keeping the main variables public void displayInfo() { super.displayInfo(); // Reuse the displayInfo method from the superclass System.out.println(&quot;Leather Seats: &quot; + leatherSeats); } } public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { Vehicle v1 = new Truck(&quot;Ford&quot;, 2023, 10.5); Vehicle v2 = new Car(&quot;Toyota&quot;, 2023, 4); Vehicle v3 = new Sedan(&quot;Honda&quot;, 2023, 4, true); System.out.println(&quot;Truck Information:&quot;); v1.displayInfo(); System.out.println(&quot; nCar Information:&quot;); v2.displayInfo(); System.out.println(&quot; nSedan Information:&quot;); v3.displayInfo(); } } Main.main(null) . Truck Information: Brand: Ford Year: 2023 Max Load Capacity: 10.5 tons Car Information: Brand: Toyota Year: 2023 Number of Doors: 4 Sedan Information: Brand: Honda Year: 2023 Number of Doors: 4 Leather Seats: true . Popcorn Hack: In your own words describe the importance of Inheritance Hierarchies . 9.6 Polymorphism . Learning Objectives . MOD-3.D: Call methods in an inheritance relationship. MOD-3.D.1: Utilize the Object class through inheritance. MOD-3.D.2: At compile time, methods in or inherited by the declared type determine the correctness of a non-static method call. MOD-3.D.3: At run-time, the method in the actual object type is executed for a non-static method call. . What is Polymorphism? . Polymorphism is a greek word meaning many-formed (poly=many, morph=form). In the context of programming, Polymorphic behavior is defined as being able to reference objects of different types at different points during compilation. . One example of Java polymorphism, is our ability to store references to objects instantiated from any class AND its subclasses in a variable. Another example is for methods, where we override the behavior of a method in a subclass such that it differs from the parent class. We successfully perform polymorphism when we override non-static methods and execute them from the correct, corresponding class at runtime. . Here is a simple example of polymorphism: . // This is our Parent class class Shape { public void draw() { System.out.println(&quot;Drawing a shape&quot;); } } // Subclass 1 class Circle extends Shape { @Override public void draw() { System.out.println(&quot;Drawing a circle&quot;); } } // Subclass 2 class Rectangle extends Shape { @Override public void draw() { System.out.println(&quot;Drawing a rectangle&quot;); } } public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { // Here we have reference variables circle and rectangle defined with static type &quot;Shape&quot; Shape circle = new Circle(); // Circle has dynamic type &quot;Circle&quot; Shape rectangle = new Rectangle(); // Rectangle has dynamic type &quot;Rectangle&quot; // Calling the draw() method circle.draw(); // Output: Drawing a circle rectangle.draw(); // Output: Drawing a rectangle } } Main.main(null); . Even though the circle and rectangle have identical data-types, the compiler knows to call the correct method at run-time. We have successfully performed polymorphism . Popcorn hack . Create any example of polymorphism, perferably with a class from your project, with corresponding methods and attributes as well. | // Program your code here . Static and Dynamic types . Typically in Java, a reference variable storing an object instantiated from a child class can only store other objects of that class. If we try to store an object of another class, we’d get an error i.e. . Integer myNumber = new Integer(6); // Instantiates an Integer object System.out.println(myNumber); // Would print Integer type 6 normally myNumber = new Double(6.1); // Compile error occurs, incompatible types System.out.println(myNumber); // This line is not reached . But what if we want want a reference variable to store objects of other classes? We get an error . Compile-time vs Runtime methods . Sometimes, when we perform polymorphism, we have to be careful to distinguish between our compile time and run-time methods. When we instantiate a dynamic variable that is of a different type from our static variable, our program at run time will attempt to search for the methods and attributes in the superclass, NOT the child class that we created. Although the compiled program will still output the correct outputs of the method in the child class, it will not be able to find a method that exists in the child class but not in the parent class. . To resolve this issue, we need use Down-casting. . Downcasting: Essentially telling the compiler to refer to a variable’s subclass (the programmer specifies this), instead of the static type. We are telling the compiler to search our dynamic type for the methods and attributes that we want to access. | . Below is an example of compile versus run-time methods and downcasting that I used in our group’s project. . import java.util.HashMap; // This is our parent class for all child classes that make up a graph public class GraphObject { private int value; // constructor public GraphObject(int value) { this.value = value; } // getter method public int getValue() { return this.value; } // setter method public void setValue(int value) { this.value = value; } // Method overloading to print object to terminal @Override public String toString() { return Integer.toString(this.value); } } // This is our child class. Represents a vertex or a node in a graph public class GraphNode extends GraphObject { private HashMap&lt;Integer,Integer&gt; edges; // Hashmap of destination vertices and weights of paths &lt;Target:Weight&gt; // Constructor of child class public GraphNode(int value, HashMap&lt;Integer,Integer&gt; edges){ super(value); // super keyword to run constructor of parent class, which sets the value of the node this.edges = edges; // adds any needed edges } public HashMap&lt;Integer,Integer&gt; getEdges() { return this.edges; } public void addEdge(int targetId, int weight) { this.edges.put(targetId, weight); } public void removeEdge(int targetId) { this.edges.remove(targetId); } // Overloading the toString method of the parent class, using super to get the output of the parent class @Override public String toString() { return &quot;GraphNode[value=&quot; + super.toString() + &quot;,edges=&quot; + this.edges + &quot;]&quot;; } } HashMap&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; node1Connections = new HashMap&lt;Integer, Integer&gt;(); node1Connections.put(2, 7); node1Connections.put(3, 2); node1Connections.put(4, 10); GraphObject node1 = new GraphNode(1, node1Connections); System.out.println(node1.toString()); ((GraphNode)node1).addEdge(5,6); // Here, we downcast node1, which is a GraphObject, to what it references, which is GraphNode // node1.addEdge(5,6); // This wouldn&#39;t work as the compiler attempts to find addEdge() in GraphObject, which it can&#39;t, throwing an error System.out.println(node1.toString()); . Popcorn Hacks . Define each of the following terms in your own words Downcasting | Static Type | Dynamic Type | Polymorphism | Compile-time method | Run-time method | . | // Do popcorn hack here . 9.7 Object Superclass . The Object class is the superclass of all other classes as well as data types and is a part of the java.lang package . | If a parent class doesn’t specify by using the extends keyword, the class will inherit from the Object . | String toString() and boolean equals(object other) are the most frequently used and subclasses of Object override the equals and toString methods by using class-specific implementations . | . Normally when you use the toString method without overriding it, it returns a hash code value as seen in the example below: . class Person { private String name; private int age; public Person(String name, int age) { this.name = name; this.age = age; } } public class ToStringNoOverride { public static void main(String[] args) { Person person = new Person(&quot;Alice&quot;, 25); // When you print this out, it will return the hash code since its using the default method for toString System.out.println(person); } } ToStringNoOverride.main(null) . REPL.$JShell$18$Person@4da14117 . However, we can fix this by creating a new method by overriding the normal toString method and building our own representation of the object . class Person { private String name; private int age; public Person(String name, int age) { this.name = name; this.age = age; } @Override public String toString() { // We override the toString method here return &quot;Person Name: &quot; + name + &quot; nPerson Age: &quot; + age; // We then add our own custom string representation } } public class ToStringOverride { public static void main(String[] args) { Person person = new Person(&quot;Alice&quot;, 25); // When you print the person object, it calls the overridden toString method we made System.out.println(person); } } ToStringOverride.main(null) . Person Name: Alice Person Age: 25 . Now, we want to compare 2 people by using boolean equals(Object other) and determine if they are the same . class Person { private String name; private int age; public Person(String name, int age) { this.name = name; this.age = age; } @Override public String toString() { return &quot;Person Name: &quot; + name + &quot; nPerson Age: &quot; + age; } } public class EqualsNoOverride { public static void main(String[] args) { Person person1 = new Person(&quot;Alice&quot;, 25); Person person2 = new Person(&quot;Bryce&quot;, 25); System.out.println(&quot;Person 1 Age equals Person 2 Age: &quot; + person1.equals(person2)); // use the equals method to compare the two people } } EqualsNoOverride.main(null) . Person 1 equals Person 2: false . False is returned when you use the boolean equals(Object other) because the parameters is of Type Object superclass is unable to detect them since the Object class saves them under two different memory addresses and to fix this, we have to make an override method for this. . To do this, we use instanceof and casting . class Person { private String name; private int age; public Person(String name, int age) { this.name = name; this.age = age; } @Override // We override the equals method public boolean equals(Object other) { if (!(other instanceof Person)) // Using instanceof, we are making sure that the we compare objects of the same class return false; Person that = (Person) other; // Here we perform casting to make sure that other is converted to Person return this.age == that.age; } @Override public String toString() { return &quot;Person Name: &quot; + name + &quot; nPerson Age: &quot; + age; } } public class EqualsOverride { public static void main(String[] args) { Person person1 = new Person(&quot;Alice&quot;, 25); Person person2 = new Person(&quot;Bryce&quot;, 25); System.out.println(&quot;Person 1 Age equals Person 2 Age: &quot; + person1.equals(person2)); } } EqualsOverride.main(null) . Person 1 Age equals Person 2 Age: true . Hacks . Create a superclass with at least 2 subclasses based on your own topic. .

Simulations utilize varying sets of values to reflect the changings states of a phenomenon . simulations can simplfly things for functionality | Simulations can contain bias from real world elements, that were chosen to be included or excluded | . Simulations work best when the real world experemnts are too impractical or time consuming. For example, simulating how different cars behave when they crash, would be much better than crashng actual cars in the real world, which would be expensive and dangerous. . . Rolling the Dice . . Simulating something like a dice roll in real life would require accounting for things like: weight, flaws in design, thrust, and gravity. . KEEP IT SIMPLE! just use a random-number generator! Ignore minor causes of variablility | . Random . “Random” is a built-in python function that allow the user to draw a random value from a set range. | A Random Number Generator (RNG) is a common simulation that selects a random value from an array. | The following code cell utilizes “random” to select a number from 1 to 100. | . #imports random module so we can use it in our code import random #sets variable random_number as a random number between 1 and 100 random_number = random.randint(1, 100) #Printing out your random Number print(random_number) . More complex usage of “random”; Coin Toss Simulation . import random def flip_coin(): return random.choice([&quot;Heads&quot;, &quot;Tails&quot;]) def coin_flip_simulation(num_flips): heads_count = 0 tails_count = 0 for _ in range(num_flips): result = flip_coin() if result == &quot;Heads&quot;: heads_count += 1 else: tails_count += 1 return heads_count, tails_count if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: num_flips = 1000 #This is the number of coin flips you want to simulate heads, tails = coin_flip_simulation(num_flips) print(&quot;Number of Heads: &quot;+ str(heads)) print(&quot;Number of Tails: &quot; + str(tails)) print(&quot;Heads Probability: &quot;+ str({heads / num_flips})) print(&quot;Tails Probability: &quot;+ str({tails / num_flips})) . Number of Heads: 501 Number of Tails: 499 Heads Probability: {0.501} Tails Probability: {0.499} . Popcorn Hack #1 . Utilize “random” to create a basic simulation of a rolling TWO dice. Print the sum of both dice rolls. Remember to practice good syntax when naming your variables. . import random #Code, Code, Code . Algorithms . Simulations often utilize algorithms and equations to perform tasks because simulations don’t always have the same output . the output of a simulation depends on the input | . An algorithm is a finite sequence of instructions used to solve problems or perform computations. . commonly used alongside functions | . Example Algorithm in a function . #Defining Function def algorithm(input): #Manipulating input and preparing it for the output. output = input+2 #Return the output return output #Call the Function to start the algorithm algorithm(5) . 7 . Mathematics . Math can also prove to be very useful in certain types of situations. | Commonly used along with Algorithms when simulating various things | . . Popcorn Hack #2 . Simulate how long an object will fall for using an algorithm, with user-inputed variables for height dropped. Use the following formula as a reference. . . t = time (output) | h = height dropped from (input) | g = constant (given) | . # Constant, Acceleration due to gravity (m/s^2) G = 9.81 def simulation(height_dropped): # Code Code Code . Using Loops in Simulations . For loops can also be used in simulations . They can simulate events that repeat but don’t always have the same output | . # Example For Loop #Creating For Loop to repeat 4 times for i in range(4): #Action that happens inside for loop print(&quot;This is run number: &quot; + str(i)) . This is run number: 0 This is run number: 1 This is run number: 2 This is run number: 3 . Popcorn Hack #3 . You are gambling addict (sigma). . Each session you roll 2 dice. . If your dice roll is greater than or equal to 9 you win the session. . If you win over 5 sessions, you win the jackpot. . Simulate your odds to predict if you will hit the jackpot (how many rounds did you win?) using a for loop and random. . # Code Code Code . BONUS POPCORN HACK . Welcome to Flight Simulator! Your goal is to complete a Python program that simulates a flight We’ve set up some initial values for altitude, speed, and fuel. Your task is to update these values to make the flight more realistic. . Your mission: | .

Be creative. python #Enter code here ## 3.17 Algorithmic Efficiency - A problem is a general description of a task that can (or cannot) be solved algorithmically - A decision problem is a problem with a yes/no answer - An optimization problem is a problem with the goal of finding the &quot;best&quot; solution among many - Efficiency is an estimate of the amount of computational resources used by an algorithm - An algorithm&#39;s efficiency is determined through formal or mathematically reasoning One way do demonstrate how algorithmic efficiency can be used to improve a program is through a simple sorting program. ## Bubble Sort Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which means the list is sorted. python def bubble_sort(list): n = len(list) for i in range(n): for j in range(0, n - i - 1): if list[j] &gt; list[j + 1]: list[j], list[j + 1] = list[j + 1], list[j] import random list = [random.randint(1, 10) for _ in range(10)] bubble_sort(list) print(&quot;Bubble Sorted listay is:&quot;, list) ## Popcorn Hack 2 - Using bubble sort, make multiple strings that sort alphabetically. python #Enter code here ## Quick Sort Quick Sort is a popular divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm. It divides the array into smaller sub-arrays and recursively sorts them. It&#39;s generally more efficient than Bubble Sort for larger lists. python def quick_sort(list): if len(list) &lt;= 1: return list else: pivot = list[0] less_than_pivot = [x for x in list[1:] if x &lt;= pivot] greater_than_pivot = [x for x in list[1:] if x &gt; pivot] return quick_sort(less_than_pivot) + [pivot] + quick_sort(greater_than_pivot) import random list = [random.randint(1, 10) for _ in range(10)] list = quick_sort(list) print(&quot;Quick Sorted listay is:&quot;, list) ## Homework Hacks # Hack 1 - Create a random decision maker that choses between 2 string options. python #Enter code here # Hack 2 Modify the following function that calculates the sum of a range of numbers from 1-99999999 more efficient. Hints: - The formula for finding the sum of an arithmetic series is n/2 * (first_number + last_number) where n is the number of terms. - To find the number of terms in a list, use len(list) - To index the first term of a list, use list[0] and to index the last term, use list[-1]. python #edit this code def calculate_sum(numbers): total = 0 for num in numbers: total += num return total #numbers = [i for i in range(1, 9999999)] print(calculate_sum(numbers)) .",

Image Representation with 2D Arrays . Digital images are essentially a collection of small, discrete elements called pixels. Pixels are organized in a 2D grid, where each pixel represents a single point of color or intensity. Each element (pixel) in the 2D array corresponds to one pixel in the image. In a color image, each pixel contains three color components: Red, Green, and Blue (RGB), while in grayscale images, each pixel has a single intensity value. . Traversing and Processing an Image . Traversing an image’s 2D array involves systematically visiting every pixel in the image grid. This process often uses nested loops, with the outer loop iterating over the rows and the inner loop iterating over the columns. By traversing the array, you gain access to each pixel’s information, such as color values or intensity. This structured access is fundamental for various image processing tasks. . import java.io.*; import java.net.URL; import javax.imageio.ImageIO; // ImageIO is a class in Java libraries which gives an easy way to use different image formats import java.awt.image.BufferedImage; // BufferedImage is a class in Java libraries to help perform operations on images (read + write) public class ImageProcessing { public static void main(String[] args) { String imageUrl = &quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111609656/277895130-d15b0768-01d9-4522-8ef7-4f8bcf69c42e.png&quot;; String outputFolder = &quot;../images&quot;; String customFileName = &quot;MORT1.png&quot;; try { String outputPath = outputFolder + File.separator + customFileName; URL url = new URL(imageUrl); // create URL object try (InputStream in = url.openStream(); // try-catch block where errors are handled OutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(outputPath)) { // input stream reads data and output stream writes the data byte[] buffer = new byte[1024]; int bytesRead; while ((bytesRead = in.read(buffer)) != -1) { out.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead); } // reading the data from the URL and writes in 1024 byte chunks } System.out.println(&quot;Image downloaded and saved to: &quot; + outputPath); File imageFile = new File(outputPath); BufferedImage image = ImageIO.read(imageFile); int width = image.getWidth(); int height = image.getHeight(); // get the image dimensions System.out.println(&quot;Success!

Grayscale conversion is a fundamental image processing operation. When converting an image to grayscale, you effectively remove color information and retain only the pixel intensity. This is typically done by calculating the average intensity from the RGB components of each pixel. The result is a grayscale image where variations in pixel intensity represent the image’s features and details. This operation can serve as a starting point for more complex image processing techniques. . import java.awt.image.BufferedImage; import java.awt.image.ColorConvertOp; import java.io.*; import java.net.URL; import javax.imageio.ImageIO; public class ImageToGrayscaleWithArray { public static void main(String[] args) { String imageUrl = &quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111609656/277895164-5f93f1d8-88b5-4b08-b9a1-b54fb6d55d96.png&quot;; // Replace with the actual image URL String outputFolder = &quot;../images&quot;; String customFileName = &quot;MORT2_Grayscale.png&quot;; // Change this to your desired file name for the grayscale image try { // Define the output file path String outputPath = outputFolder + File.separator + customFileName; // Create a URL object from the image URL URL url = new URL(imageUrl); // Open a connection to the URL and get the input stream try (InputStream in = url.openStream(); OutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(outputPath)) { // Read data from the URL and save it to the output file byte[] buffer = new byte[1024]; int bytesRead; while ((bytesRead = in.read(buffer)) != -1) { out.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead); } } // Read the downloaded image BufferedImage originalImage = ImageIO.read(new File(outputPath)); int width = originalImage.getWidth(); int height = originalImage.getHeight(); // Create a 2D array to store grayscale values int[][] grayscaleArray = new int[width][height]; // Convert the image to grayscale and populate the array for (int x = 0; x &lt; width; x++) { for (int y = 0; y &lt; height; y++) { int pixel = originalImage.getRGB(x, y); int red = (pixel &gt;&gt; 16) &amp; 0xFF; int green = (pixel &gt;&gt; 8) &amp; 0xFF; int blue = pixel &amp; 0xFF; int gray = (red + green + blue) / 3; grayscaleArray[x][y] = gray; } } // Save the grayscale image String grayscaleOutputPath = outputFolder + File.separator + customFileName; BufferedImage grayscaleImage = new BufferedImage(width, height, BufferedImage.TYPE_BYTE_GRAY); for (int x = 0; x &lt; width; x++) { for (int y = 0; y &lt; height; y++) { int grayValue = grayscaleArray[x][y]; int grayPixel = (grayValue &lt;&lt; 16) | (grayValue &lt;&lt; 8) | grayValue; grayscaleImage.setRGB(x, y, grayPixel); } } ImageIO.write(grayscaleImage, &quot;png&quot;, new File(grayscaleOutputPath)); System.out.println(&quot;Success!

What are 2D arrays? | How are 2D arrays organized? | What are some real-world examples of 2D arrays? | . The Basics/Recap . 2D arrays, and higher dimension arrays overall, can be thought of as just an array that’s made up of other arrays or an array of arrays. One way of looking at 2D arrays is by thinking of them as a chess board. They have rows and columns, and every element is identified via row or column number or index. . Below is an illustration of a 2D array: . 1) How to declare/initialize 2D arrays . Initializing 2D arrays can be done in multiple different ways. Note: In Java whenever we declare an array we must specify the datatype of the elements in the array. The most common include: . 1) Initializing and populating the array in one go: . public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { int[][] Array1 = { // 2d Array of integers {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9} }; for (int i = 0; i &lt; Array1.length; i++) { // Loop through the rows for (int j = 0; j &lt; Array1[i].length; j++) { // Loop through the columns System.out.print(Array1[i][j] + &quot; &quot;); // Print out the element } System.out.println(); // Print a new line } } } Main.main(null) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 . public class Main { public static void main(String[] args){ String[][] Array2 = { // 2d Array of strings {&quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, &quot;three&quot;}, {&quot;four&quot;, &quot;five&quot;, &quot;six&quot;}, {&quot;seven&quot;, &quot;eight&quot;, &quot;nine&quot;} }; for (int i = 0; i &lt; Array2.length; i++) { // Loop through the rows for (int j = 0; j &lt; Array2[i].length; j++) { // Loop through the columns System.out.print(Array2[i][j] + &quot; &quot;); // Print out the element } System.out.println(); // Print a new line } } } Main.main(null) . one two three four five six seven eight nine . public class Main { public static void main(String[] args){ Object[][] Array3 = { // 2d Array of objects allows for having varying types in the same 2d array {1, &quot;two&quot;, 3.0}, {4, &quot;five&quot;, 6.0}, {7, &quot;eight&quot;, 9.0} }; for (int i = 0; i &lt; Array3.length; i++) { // Loop through the rows for (int j = 0; j &lt; Array3[i].length; j++) { // Loop through the columns System.out.print(Array3[i][j] + &quot; &quot;); // Print out the element } System.out.println(); // Print a new line } } } Main.main(null) . 1 two 3.0 4 five 6.0 7 eight 9.0 . 2) Creating an empty 2D array and then assigning values to individual elements as through accessing and changing each value via their corresponding row and column index: . public class Main { public static void main(String[] args){ int[][] myArray = new int[3][3]; // Defines the size of the array, think of the first number as x and the second number as y, for rows and columns. myArray[0][0] = 1; // Maps the desired value to a specific point in the array, think of this as an (x,y) coordinate. myArray[0][1] = 2; myArray[0][2] = 3; myArray[1][0] = 4; myArray[1][1] = 5; myArray[1][2] = 6; myArray[2][0] = 7; myArray[2][1] = 8; myArray[2][2] = 9; for (int i = 0; i &lt; myArray.length; i++) { // Loop through the rows for (int j = 0; j &lt; myArray[i].length; j++) { // Loop through the columns System.out.print(myArray[i][j] + &quot; &quot;); // Print out the element } System.out.println(); // Print a new line } } } Main.main(null) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 . 3) Using a nested loop to manually populate each element: . public class Main { public static void main(String[] args){ int rows = 3; // Define number of rows and columns here as variables int columns = 4; int[][] myArray = new int[rows][columns]; // Create an array based on the values of the aforementioned variables. // Create a nested for loop that iterates based on the number of rows and columns. for (int i = 0; i &lt; rows; i++) { for (int j = 0; j &lt; columns; j++) { // You can assign values to each element here myArray[i][j] = i * columns + j; } } // Print out the array for (int i = 0; i &lt; myArray.length; i++) { // Loop through the rows for (int j = 0; j &lt; myArray[i].length; j++) { // Loop through the columns System.out.print(myArray[i][j] + &quot; &quot;); // Print out the element } System.out.println(); // Print a new line } } } Main.main(null) . 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 . Popcorn Hack: Create a 2D Array with random values . public class Main { public static void main(String[] args){ } } Main.main(null) . 2) Accessing and updating the values of a 2D array . In order to access the value of a 2D array, you must use array indexing notation, which is as follows: . // Say you have myArray: int[][] myArray = { {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9} }; // To access the third number of the third column, use array indexing notation: int desiredValue = myArray[2][2]; // REMEMBER BASE 0! // And print the value: System.out.print(desiredValue); . Assign the “coordinate point” of the desired value as a variable, using the “x” value for row number and “y” value for column number. . // Executable Version: public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { int[][] myArray = { {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9} }; int desiredValue = myArray[2][2]; System.out.print(desiredValue); } } Main.main(null) . 9 . In order to update the value of a specific point in a 2D array, assign the desired value to a specific point in the array, denoted by array indexing notation: . // Say you have myArray: int[][] myArray = { {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9} }; // To change the third number of the third column, use array indexing notation: int desiredValue = 10; // Define what you want the new value to be. myArray[2][2] = desiredValue; // Use array indexing notation to insert the desired value at the specific desired point. // And print the updated value at the desired location: System.out.print(myArray[2][2]); . // Executable Version: public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { int[][] myArray = { {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9} }; int desiredValue = 10; myArray[2][2] = desiredValue; System.out.print(myArray[2][2]); } } Main.main(null) . 10 . Popcorn Hack: Print all the values on this 2D Array and update the last value to be 12. . // basic scaffolding to get you started :) public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { int[][] myArray = { {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9} }; } } Main.main(null) . 3) Traversing 2D Arrays . When we traverse a regular array we use a singular for loop to iterate through each element in the array. However, when we have 2D array we need to use nested for loops to iterate through each element in the array. Below is the difference between the two: | . // Regular array traversal for(int i = 0; i &lt; myArray.length; i++){ System.out.println(myArray[i]); } // 2D array traversal for(int i = 0; i &lt; myArray.length; i++){ for(int j = 0; j &lt; myArray[i].length; j++){ System.out.println(myArray[i][j]); } } . public class Main { public static void main(String[] args){ int[] myArray = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}; // 1d array of integers int[][] my2dArray = { // 2d array of integers {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9} }; System.out.println(&quot;1D Array n&quot;); // Print a new line for (int i = 0; i &lt; myArray.length; i++) { // Loop through the 1d array System.out.print(myArray[i] + &quot; &quot;); // Print out the element } System.out.println(&quot; n n2D Array n&quot;); // Print a new line for (int i = 0; i &lt; my2dArray.length; i++) { // First traversal condition for (int j = 0; j &lt; my2dArray[i].length; j++) { // Second traversal condition System.out.print(my2dArray[i][j] + &quot; &quot;); // Print out the element } System.out.println(); // Print a new line } } } Main.main(null) . 1D Array 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 2D Array 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 . Popcorn Hack: Traverse the following array and only print the values divisible by 7 . public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { int[][] myArray = { {1, 2, 11}, {14, 5, 21}, {25, 28, 70} }; } } Main.main(null) . Row-Major Order vs Column-Major Order . Row-Major-Order: . The outer loop traverses the rows and the inner loop traverses the columns or the elements within the rows. Here is an example bellow of row-major order traversals: | . public class rowMajorOrder { public static void main(String[] args){ int[][] my2dArray = { // 2d array of integers {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9} }; System.out.println(&quot;Row Major Order n&quot;); // Print a new line for (int i = 0; i &lt; my2dArray.length; i++) { // First traversal traverses by rows condition for (int j = 0; j &lt; my2dArray[i].length; j++) { // Iterates through the columns if (my2dArray[i][j] % 2 == 0) { // If the element is even } else{ my2dArray[i][j] = 0; // Otherwise set the element to 0 } System.out.print(my2dArray[i][j] + &quot; &quot;); // Print out the element } System.out.println(); // Print a new line } } } rowMajorOrder.main(null) . Row Major Order 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 0 . // Variation that only applies to forward row-wise major traversal public class rowMajorTraversalAlt{ public static void rowMajorOrderAlt(int[][] array){ for (int[] row: array){ for (int element: row){ System.out.print(element + &quot; &quot;); } System.out.println(); } } } rowMajorTraversalAlt.rowMajorOrderAlt(new int[][]{ {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9} }); . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 . Column-Major-Order: . The outer loop will traverse through the columns and the inner loop will traverses through each element in the columns or the rows. Here is an example bellow of column-major order traversals: | . public class columnWiseTraversal{ public static void main(String[] args){ int[][] my2dArray = { // 2d array of integers {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9} }; System.out.println(&quot;Column Wise Traversal n&quot;); // Print a new line for (int j = 0; j &lt; my2dArray[0].length; j++) { // First traversal traverses by columns condition for (int i = 0; i &lt; my2dArray.length; i++) { // Iterates through the rows if (my2dArray[j][i] % 2 == 0) { // If the element is even } else{ my2dArray[j][i] = 0; // Otherwise set the element to 0 } System.out.print(my2dArray[j][i] + &quot; &quot;); // Print out the element } System.out.println(); // Print a new line } } } columnWiseTraversal.main(null) // Both row and column wise traversals in our examples do the same thing, but in different orders. However for certain functions one may be easier to use than the other. . Column Wise Traversal 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 0 . Algoirthms 2D Array Java . Linear search is a simple and sequential searching algorithm. It is used to find whether a particular element is present in the array or not by traversing every element in the array. While searching in the 2D array is exactly the same but here all the cells need to be traversed In this way, any element is searched in a 2D array. . Below is the implementation for linear search in 2D arrays . // Linear Search in 2D arrays import java.util.Arrays; public class GFG { public static void main(String[] args) { int arr[][] = { { 3, 12, 9 }, { 5, 2, 89 }, { 90, 45, 22 } }; int target = 89; int ans[] = linearSearch(arr, target); System.out.println(&quot;Element found at index: &quot; + Arrays.toString(ans)); } static int[] linearSearch(int[][] arr, int target) { for (int i = 0; i &lt; arr.length; i++) { for (int j = 0; j &lt; arr[i].length; j++) { if (arr[i][j] == target) { return new int[] { i, j }; } } } return new int[] { -1, -1 }; } } . Summary: Linear Search involves iterating through all elements in the matrix. Binary Search is applicable when the matrix is sorted. Binary Search treats the 2D matrix as a 1D array by converting the indices. These searching algorithms are fundamental and widely used. Practice applying them to different scenarios to solidify your understanding. Additionally, consider exploring more advanced searching techniques for 2D arrays as you become more proficient. . public class Main { public static int[] binarySearch(int[][] matrix, int target) { int rows = matrix.length; int cols = matrix[0].length; int left = 0; int right = rows * cols - 1; while (left &lt;= right) { int mid = left + (right - left) / 2; int midValue = matrix[mid / cols][mid % cols]; if (midValue == target) { return new int[] {mid / cols, mid % cols}; } if (midValue &lt; target) { left = mid + 1; } else { right = mid - 1; } } return new int[] {-1, -1}; // Target not found } } . Binary Search in a 2D Array: . Binary search is an efficient method of searching in an array. Binary search works on a sorted array. At each iteration the search space is divided in half, this is the reason why binary search is more efficient than linear search . // Binary Search on sorted 2D array import java.util.Arrays; class GFG { static int[] findAns(int[][] arr, int target) { int row = 0; int col = arr[row].length - 1; while (row &lt; arr.length &amp;&amp; col &gt;= 0) { if (arr[row][col] == target) { return new int[] { row, col }; } // Target lies in further row if (arr[row][col] &lt; target) { row++; } // Target lies in previous column else { col--; } } return new int[] { -1, -1 }; } // Driver Code public static void main(String[] args) { // Binary search in sorted matrix int arr[][] = { { 1, 2, 3, 4 }, { 5, 6, 7, 8 }, { 9, 10, 11, 12 } }; int[] ans = findAns(arr, 12); System.out.println(&quot;Element found at index: &quot; + Arrays.toString(ans)); } } . Enhanced For-Each Loop for 2D Arrays . Since 2D arrays are really arrays of arrays you can also use a nested enhanced for-each loop to loop through all elements in an array. We loop through each of the inner arrays and loop through all the values in each inner array. Notice the type of the outer loop array variable – it is an array that will hold each row, String[] in the example below for a 2D String array. The type of the variables in the for-each loops must match the type of the array. For-each loops are much simpler since you don’t have to use the indices and the []’s, but you can only use them if you are not going to change the values in an array of primitive types since the variable val below will not change the original array. . String[][] array; // Nested For-each loops that traverse a 2D String array for (String[] innerArray : array) { for (String val : innerArray) { System.out.println(val); } } . public class Average { public static double getAvg(int[][] a) { double total = 0; for (int[] innerArray : a) { for (int val : innerArray) { total = total + val; } } return total / (a.length * a[0].length); } public static void main(String[] args) { int[][] theArray = { {80, 90, 70}, {20, 80, 75}}; System.out.println(getAvg(theArray)); } } Average.main(null); . 69.16666666666667 . 4) How to create an algorithm that involves traversing a 2D Array . During the APCSA AP exam, we will be required to write an algorithm for a 2D array that solves a problem discussed in the prompt. Collegeboard will give you a situation, and you will have to write an algorithm based on said situation. . Here’s an example of an algorithm that was needed for the real Collegeboard APCSA exam in 2022: . For this problem, the question asked for the student to write the countIncreasingCols method, which returns the number of columns in grid that are in increasing order. grid is a 2D array with randomly populated numbers. . public int countIncreaseCols() { int count = 0; for (int j = 0; j &lt; grid[0].length; j++) { // Iterates through columns boolean isIncreasing = true; if (grid[0].length &gt; 1) { // Checks if there is more than one column to prevent out of bounds error for (int i = 1; i &lt; grid.length; i++) { // Iterates through rows if (grid[i][j] &lt;= grid[i - 1][j]) { // Checks if the current element is less than or equal to the previous element isIncreasing = false; // If so set isIncreasing to false and break out of loop break; } } if (isIncreasing) { // If the column is increasing increment count as if count++; // the value is not less than or equal to the previous // element then it must be increasing } } else if (grid[0].length == 1) { // To match the criteria of a single column being increasing count++; } else { // If there are no columns then break out of loop break; } } return count; } . Hacks: . 1) . Initialize a 5 x 5 2D array that is populated by random values. . // Add the code here: public class random2DA { } . 2) . a) Print the values 47, 51, and 20 by accessing them in the the given two-dimensional array. | b) Find the values from part a) using row major and column major order and print the values in each respective order. | . public class Problem2 { public static void main(String[] args) { int[][] arr = { {47,3,12},{51,74,20} }; } } Problem2.main(null); . 3) . The following 2d array myArray is populated with integers 1-9. Write an algorithm thath sorts the 2D array by column and returnst the values of the array in increaing order. . The expected output is: 1 4 7 2 5 8 3 6 9 . public class Problem3 { public static void main(String[] args) { int[][] MyArray = { // 2d array of integers {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9} }; } } Problem3.main(null); . 4) . Replace the “ADD CODE HERE” below with the code to declare and create a 3 by 3 two-dimensional int array named table. The finished code will print the values 0 to 8. . public class Test1 { public static void main(String[] args) { // ADD CODE HERE // // Should print the values in table int count = 0; for (int row = 0; row &lt; table.length; row++) { for (int col = 0; col &lt; table.length; col++) { table[row][col] = count; count++; System.out.print(table[row][col] + &quot; &quot;); } } } } . 5) . Replace the “ADD CODE HERE” below with the code to declare and initialize a two-dimensional String array called students with the names “Brice, Marvin, Anna” in the first row and “Kamal, Maria, Elissa” in the second. The finished code will print all the names in the array starting with all in the first row followed by all in the second row. . public class Test1 { public static void main(String[] args) { // ADD CODE HERE // // Should print the values in students in order for (int row = 0; row &lt;= students.length; row++) { for (int col = 0; col &lt;= students.length; col++) { System.out.print(students[row][col] + &quot; &quot;); } } } } .",

Learning Objectives: . Select approproate libraries or existing code segments to use in creating new programs | . What are Libraries? In Python, a library is a collection of pre-written code, functions, and modules that extend the language’s capabilities. These libraries are designed to be reused by developers to perform common tasks, rather than having to write the code from scratch. Libraries are essential for simplifying and accelerating the development process, as they provide a wide range of tools and functions for various purposes. . Here are some key points about Python libraries: . Modules: Libraries in Python consist of modules, which are individual Python files containing functions, classes, and variables related to a specific set of tasks or a particular domain. You can import these modules into your own Python code to access their functionality. . | Standard Library: Python comes with a comprehensive standard library that includes modules for various tasks, such as working with files, networking, data processing, and more. These modules are readily available and do not require installation. . | Third-party Libraries: In addition to the standard library, there is a vast ecosystem of third-party libraries created by the Python community. These libraries cover a wide range of domains, including web development, data analysis, machine learning, game development, and more. Some popular third-party libraries include NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, Django, Flask, and many others. . | How Do We Get Libraries into Our Code and Working?&lt;/strong&gt; To get libraries into our code, we use the import statement followed by the library we want to import. Lets start simply: . #In this code cell, we are importing the math library which allows us to do math operations, #and the random library which lets us take pseudorandom numbers and choices. import math import random #We use the libraries by first calling them by their name, then using one of their methods. #For example: num = 64 print(math.sqrt(num)) numList = [1,2,3,4,5,6] print(random.choice(numList)) #Here, &#39;math&#39; and &#39;random&#39; are the names of the libraries, and &#39;sqrt&#39; and &#39;choice&#39; are the names of the methods. . We can also import parts of libraries by adding a &quot;from&quot; in front of our import. . from math import sqrt from random import * num = 64 print(sqrt(num)) numList = [1,2,3,4,5,6] print(choice(numList)) . Now, we don&#39;t have to use math. in front of sqrt, and can just use the function by itself. We can also import *, or all, which makes it so that everything is imported. Here, we don&#39;t have to use random in front of choice, even though we didn&#39;t import choice specifically. Popcorn Hack #1 Import your own library from a list of provided libraries, and use one of its methods. This can be something very bare bones, such as printing the time, getting a random number in a list, or doing something after sleeping a certain amount of time python #math library module examples: sqrt(num), square(num), cube(num), factorial(num) #random library module examples: choice(list), randrange(lowest, highest, step[numbers chosen in multiples of {step}]) #datetime library module examples: datetime.now() #sleep library module examples: sleep(milliseconds) Documentation&lt;/strong&gt; Documentation in Python libraries refers to the written information and explanations provided to help users understand how to use the library, its classes, functions, and modules. It serves as a comprehensive guide that documents the library&#39;s functionality, usage, and often includes code examples. Documentation is typically created by the library developers and is an essential component of a well-maintained library. Examples of Documentation: An introductory section explaining the purpose of the library, a section on how to install the library, basic usage examples, etc. python calcAverage(grades) &#39;&#39;&#39; You know the name of the procedure and the perameters, but... You probably wouldn&#39;t be able to use this procedure with confidence because you don&#39;t know its function exactly (maybe you can guess that it finds the average, but you wouldn&#39;t know if it uses mean, mode, or median to find the average). You would also need more information on the perameters. &#39;&#39;&#39; Libraries and APIs&lt;/strong&gt; - A file that contains procedures that cane be used in a program is called a library - An Application Program Interface (API) provides specifications for how procedures in a library behave and can be used. APIs define the methods and functions that are available for developers to interact with a library. They specify how to make requests, provide inputs, and receive outputs, creating a clear and consistent way to use library features. Which libraries will be very important to us? Requests - Simplifies working with HTTP servers, including &#39;request&#39;-ing data from them, and recieving it | Pillow - Simplifies image processing | Pandas - Simplifies data analysis &amp; manipulation | Numpy - Vastly quickens functionality of arrays up to 50 times faster than regular python list | Scikit-Learn - Implements machine learning models and statistical modelling | Tensorflow - Data automation, model tracking, performance monitoring, and model retraining | Matplotlib - Creates static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python | . DON&#39;T FORGET TO DOWNLOAD ALL OF THESE (pip install &quot;library&quot;) . Popcorn Hack #2 Using the requests library and the ? module (since we should already be using this in our backend) GET a request from the api at &quot;https://api.github.com&quot; python import requests #GET a request using the requests library. Remember to put your api link in quotes! If you get something along the lines of response [200] then you succeeded ## Scikit-Learn and Numpy This code uses NumPy to create an array, and Scikit-Learn to analyze the data. It creates a linear regression which describes the relationship between the x and y arrays which reperesent independent and dependent variables. In simpler terms, it is creating a line of best fit between the two data sets, just like how you would in something like desmos. &gt; python import numpy as np import numpy as np from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error # Generate some example data X = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]).reshape(-1, 1) # Feature (independent variable) y = np.array([2, 4, 5, 4, 5]) # Target (dependent variable) # Split the data into training and testing sets X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42) # Create a Linear Regression model model = LinearRegression() # Fit the model to the training data model.fit(X_train, y_train) # Make predictions on the test data y_pred = model.predict(X_test) # Evaluate the model by calculating the Mean Squared Error mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred) # Print the model coefficients and MSE, model coefficient is the slope of the linear regression line, MSE is how well the model is performing, the closer it is to 0 the better print(&quot;Model Coefficients:&quot;, model.coef_) print(&quot;Mean Squared Error:&quot;, mse) intercept = model.intercept_ slope = model.coef_[0] print(f&quot;Linear Regression Equation: y = {intercept} + {slope} * X&quot;) ## Request - The requests module allows you to send HTTP requests using Python. - In order to download requests, you would have to type pip install requests in your terminal. ## Syntax - requests.methodname(params) python import requests x = requests.get(&#39;http://127.0.0.1:9008/&#39;) print(x.text) #not functional code, example of syntax python import requests # Replace this URL with the website you want to request url = &#39;https://www.example.com&#39; # Send a GET request to the URL response = requests.get(url) # Check if the request was successful (status code 200) if response.status_code == 200: # Print the content of the response (the HTML content of the webpage) print(response.text) else: # If the request was not successful, print an error message print(f&quot;Failed to retrieve the page. Status code: {response.status_code}&quot;) ## Pillow - Pillow is a imaging library that provides easy-to-use methods to include, change, save different image formats. - To dowload pillow onto your computer, you would enter the command pip install Pillow into your terminal. python from PIL import Image, ImageDraw, ImageFont # Create a new blank image width, height = 400, 200 image = Image.new(&quot;RGB&quot;, (width, height), &quot;white&quot;) # Create an ImageDraw object draw = ImageDraw.Draw(image) # Draw a red line from (50, 50) to (350, 150) line_color = (255, 0, 0) # Red color draw.line((50, 50, 350, 150), fill=line_color, width=3) # Add text to the image text = &quot;This was created using Pillow!&quot; text_color = (0, 0, 0) # Black color font_size = 20 font = ImageFont.load_default() # Use a default font text_position = (50, 160) draw.text(text_position, text, fill=text_color, font=font) # Save or display the image image.show() image.show() #This opens the image in your default image viewer and when you stop the code, it will return an error, but don&#39;t worry about that python from PIL import Image # Open an image original_image = Image.open(&#39;image.png&#39;) #replace image.png with valid image # Display information about the image width, height = original_image.size format = original_image.format print(f&quot;Original Image Size: {width}x{height}&quot;) print(f&quot;Original Image Format: {format}&quot;) # Resize the image to a new size new_size = (width // 2, height // 2) # Reduce the size by half resized_image = original_image.resize(new_size) # Save the resized image resized_image.save(&#39;resized_image.jpg&#39;) # Display information about the resized image resized_width, resized_height = resized_image.size print(f&quot;Resized Image Size: {resized_width}x{resized_height}&quot;) # Show both the original and resized images original_image.show() resized_image.show() FileNotFoundError Traceback (most recent call last) c: Users matth librarylesson lessons 2023-10-26-Libraries.ipynb Cell 26 line 4 1 from PIL import Image 3 # Open an image -&gt; 4 original_image = Image.open(&#39;image.png&#39;) 6 # Display information about the image 7 width, height = original_image.size File c: Users matth AppData Local Programs Python Python311 Lib site-packages PIL Image.py:3243, in open(fp, mode, formats) 3240 filename = fp 3242 if filename: -&gt; 3243 fp = builtins.open(filename, &quot;rb&quot;) 3244 exclusive_fp = True 3246 try: FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: &#39;image.png&#39; ## Pandas This code utilizes pandas in the DataFrame form to organize the data in to a table with the categories on the horizontal axis and their values on the vertical. Pandas creates a way for the user to organize data in a much simpler form and in different styles depending on what the user wants python #This code utilizes pandas which is a way for you as a user, to create data tables that are much more organized #imports pandas so it&#39;s able to be used import pandas as pd #data is created and will be sorted from left to right into top to bottom data = {&#39;Name&#39;: [&#39;Matthew&#39;, &#39;Lindsay&#39;, &#39;Josh&#39;, &#39;Ethan&#39;], &#39;Grade&#39;: [97, 92, 90, 80]} #defines a variable and utilizes pandas by using a DataFrame for the data df = pd.DataFrame(data) #tbere are other forms other than DataFrame, those are Series (single Column), Panel (3D), Multindex (multiple levels of index), and Categorical (categories), #increase the side count by one df.index += 1 print(df) Name Grade 1 Matthew 97 2 Lindsay 92 3 Josh 90 4 Ethan 80 Another example code, this time utilizing both numpy and pandas python import pandas as pd import numpy as np # Sample data data = { &#39;Grade&#39;: [&#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39;, &#39;A&#39;, &#39;C&#39;, &#39;B&#39;, &#39;C&#39;, &#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39;, &#39;A&#39;], &#39;Percent&#39;: [94, 82, 91, 76, 89, 79, 92, 87, 99] } # Create a Pandas DataFrame df = pd.DataFrame(data) # Calculate the mean of each Grade using NumPy means = df.groupby(&#39;Grade&#39;)[&#39;Percent&#39;].mean().reset_index() # Organize the results into a new data table result = pd.DataFrame({&#39;Grade&#39;: [&#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39;, &#39;C&#39;], &#39;Mean Grade&#39;: means[&#39;Percent&#39;]}) result.index += 1 # Display the result print(result) Grade Mean Grade 1 A 94.0 2 B 86.0 3 C 77.5 ## TensorFlow The provided code demonstrates a basic example of linear regression using TensorFlow and Keras. It begins by importing the necessary libraries, TensorFlow and NumPy. It then generates a synthetic dataset with 1000 samples, where the input features are random, and the target values are computed as a linear combination of the input features with added noise. A data pipeline is set up using TensorFlow, which includes shuffling and batching the data for efficient processing. A simple linear regression model is defined using Keras, consisting of one dense layer. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and mean squared error as the loss function. It is then trained on the synthetic data for ten epochs. After training, the model is used to make predictions on new data points, and the predictions are printed to the console. This code provides a basic illustration of how to perform a simple machine learning task with TensorFlow, from data generation to model training and prediction. python import tensorflow as tf import numpy as np # Create a synthetic dataset num_samples = 1000 input_data = np.random.rand(num_samples, 2) target_data = input_data[:, 0] * 2 + input_data[:, 1] * 3 + np.random.randn(num_samples) # Define a data pipeline using TensorFlow dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((input_data, target_data)) dataset = dataset.shuffle(buffer_size=num_samples) dataset = dataset.batch(32) dataset = dataset.prefetch(buffer_size=tf.data.AUTOTUNE) # Create a simple linear regression model using Keras model = tf.keras.Sequential([ tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, input_shape=(2,)) ]) model.compile(optimizer=&#39;adam&#39;, loss=&#39;mean_squared_error&#39;) # Train the model on the synthetic data model.fit(dataset, epochs=10) # Generate predictions new_data = np.array([[0.5, 0.7], [0.3, 0.2]]) predictions = model.predict(new_data) print(&quot;Predictions:&quot;, predictions) Epoch 1/10 32/32 [==============================] - 0s 2ms/step - loss: 3.8766 Epoch 2/10 32/32 [==============================] - 0s 2ms/step - loss: 3.6717 Epoch 3/10 32/32 [==============================] - 0s 2ms/step - loss: 3.4812 Epoch 4/10 32/32 [==============================] - 0s 2ms/step - loss: 3.3002 Epoch 5/10 32/32 [==============================] - 0s 2ms/step - loss: 3.1319 Epoch 6/10 32/32 [==============================] - 0s 1ms/step - loss: 2.9735 Epoch 7/10 32/32 [==============================] - 0s 2ms/step - loss: 2.8254 Epoch 8/10 32/32 [==============================] - 0s 2ms/step - loss: 2.6876 Epoch 9/10 32/32 [==============================] - 0s 2ms/step - loss: 2.5581 Epoch 10/10 32/32 [==============================] - 0s 2ms/step - loss: 2.4363 1/1 [==============================] - 0s 85ms/step Predictions: [[1.6355244] [0.9337466]] ## Matplotlib The provided Python code demonstrates the basic usage of Matplotlib, a popular library for creating data visualizations. In this example, we start by importing the Matplotlib&#39;s pyplot module, often aliased as plt. We define some sample data as lists for the X and Y values. Then, we create a figure and an axis object using plt.subplots(). Next, we plot the data points on the graph with ax.plot(x, y) and set a label for the line. We also add labels for the X and Y axes and set a title for the plot. To provide context for the plot, we include a legend with the label we set earlier. Finally, plt.show() is called to display the graph. When you run this code, it will generate a simple line plot displaying the data points with appropriate labels, a title, and a legend, making it a clear and informative visualization. python import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Sample data x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] y = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] # Create a figure and axis fig, ax = plt.subplots() # Plot the data ax.plot(x, y, label=&#39;Linear Line&#39;) # Set labels and title ax.set_xlabel(&#39;X-axis&#39;) ax.set_ylabel(&#39;Y-axis&#39;) ax.set_title(&#39;Simple Line Plot&#39;) # Add a legend ax.legend() # Display the plot plt.show() ![png](output_33_0.png) Homework Hack . 1) Create a code that makes a data table which organizes the average values(mean) from a data set the has atleast 5 values per category and using 2 libraries, ex: &lt;/br&gt; 2) Create a Python script that downloads images from a website using the requests library, processes them with the Pillow library, and then performs data analysis with the Pandas library. python #homework 1 python #homework 2",

            "content": "What is a Library? . Essentially a list of pre-written code that you can use to streamline and clean up your program. . Libraries can help simplify complex programs . APIS are specifications for how the procedures in a library behave, and how they can be used . Documentations for an API/library is necessary in understanding the behaviors provided by the API/library and how to use them . Libraries that we will go over: Requests, Pillow, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, matplotlib. . Required Installations . Please run the following commands in your vscode terminal in order to continue the lesson . pip install numpy | pip install matplotlib | pip install scikit-learn | pip install pillow | pip install pandas | pip install tensorflow | pip install requests | . Images using requests and pillow libraries . ‘Requests’ is focused on handling HTTP requests and web data while ‘Pillow’ is designed for data manipulation and analysis It’s common to see them used together in data-related assignments where data is fetched by HTTP requests using Requests and then processed and analyzed with Pandas. . Here’s an example: . import requests from PIL import Image from io import BytesIO # Step 1: Download an image using Requests image_url = &quot;https://example.com/path/to/your/image.jpg&quot; # Replace with the actual URL of the image you want to download response = requests.get(image_url) if response.status_code == 200: # Step 2: Process the downloaded image using Pillow image_data = BytesIO(response.content) # Create an in-memory binary stream from the response content img = Image.open(image_data) # Open the image using Pillow # Perform image processing tasks here, like resizing or applying filters img = img.resize((x, y)) # Resize the image and replace x,y with desired amounts # Step 3: Save the processed image using Pillow img.save(&quot;processed_image.jpg&quot;) # Save the processed image to a file print(&quot;Image downloaded, processed, and saved.&quot;) else: print(f&quot;Failed to download image. Status code: {response.status_code}&quot;) . In this code, we use the Requests library to download an image from a URL and then if the download is successful the HTTP status code 200 will pop up, and from there we create an in-memory binary stream (BytesIO) from the response content. We then use the Pillow library to open the image, make any necessary changes, and save the processed image to a file. . Here’s a step by step tutorial on how we wrote this code: 1)We started by importing the necessary libraries, which were Requests, Pillow, and io. . 2)Download the Image . 3)Use the Requests library to send an HTTP GET request to the URL to download the image. Check the response status code to make sure the download goes through(status code 200). . 4)If the download is successful, create an in-memory binary stream (BytesIO) from the response content. Process the Image: . 5)Utilize the Pillow library to open the image from the binary stream. Change photo to desired preference(ie: size) Save the Processed Image: . 6)Save the processed image to a file using Pillow. Choose a filename and file format for the saved image. . Hack 1 . Write a Python code that accomplishes the following tasks: . Downloads an image from a specified URL using the Requests library. Processes the downloaded image (like resizing) using the Pillow library. Save the processed image to a file. . #Code here . Math Operations With Python Libraries . Numpy(Numerical Python) is used for numerical and scientific computing. It provides tools for handling large sets of numbers, such as data tables and arrays. Numpy makes it easier and more efficient to do mathematical tasks. . The Matplotlib library lets you create a visual representation of your data (graphs, charts, and etc.) . Example Sine Graph . Uses numpy and matplotlib libaries . import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Generate sample data with NumPy x = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 100) # Create an array of values from 0 to 2*pi # 100 is included to have 100 points distributed between 0 and 2π to make graph smoother y = np.sin(x) # Compute the sine of each value # Create a simple line plot using Matplotlib plt.plot(x, y, label=&#39;Sine Function&#39;, color=&#39;blue&#39;, linestyle=&#39;-&#39;) # Create the plot plt.title(&#39;Sine Function&#39;) # Set the title plt.xlabel(&#39;x&#39;) # Label for the x-axis plt.ylabel(&#39;sin(x)&#39;) # Label for the y-axis plt.grid(True) # Display a grid plt.legend() # Show the legend plt.show() # Display the plot . Hack 2 . Using the data from the numpy library, create a visual graph using different matplotlib functions. . import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Generate data for two lines x = np.linspace(0, 10, 50) # Create an array of values from 0 to 10 y1 = 2 * x + 1 # Set of data poits # Create and display a plot using Matplotlib # your code here . Tensor Flow is used in deep learning and neural networks, while scikit-learn is used for typical machine learning tasks. When used together, they can tackle machine learning projects. In the code below, Tensor Flow is used for model creation and training. Scikit-learn is used for data-processing and model evaluation. . Pip install tensorflow scikit-learn . import numpy as np import tensorflow as tf from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler from tensorflow import keras from tensorflow.keras import layers # Generate synthetic data np.random.seed(0) X = np.random.rand(100, 1) # Feature y = 2 * X + 1 + 0.1 * np.random.randn(100, 1) # Target variable with noise # Split the data into training and testing sets X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42) # Standardize the features scaler = StandardScaler() X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train) X_test = scaler.transform(X_test) # Create a simple linear regression model using TensorFlow and Keras model = keras.Sequential([ layers.Input(shape=(1,)), layers.Dense(1) ]) # Compile the model model.compile(optimizer=&#39;adam&#39;, loss=&#39;mean_squared_error&#39;) # Train the model model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=32, verbose=2) # Make predictions on the test set y_pred = model.predict(X_test) # Calculate the Mean Squared Error on the test set mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred) print(f&quot;Mean Squared Error: {mse:.4f}&quot;) . A decrease in loss and time metrics (ms/epoch and ms/step) shows the efficiency increases as the training epochs increases . Hack . fill in the missing code to match the custom data set . import numpy as np import tensorflow as tf from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler from tensorflow import keras from tensorflow.keras import layers # Generate a custom dataset (replace this with your data loading code) # Synthetic data: House prices based on number of bedrooms and square footage np.random.seed(0) num_samples = 100 bedrooms = np.random.randint(1, 5, num_samples) square_footage = np.random.randint(1000, 2500, num_samples) house_prices = 100000 + 50000 * bedrooms + 100 * square_footage + 10000 * np.random.randn(num_samples) # Combine features (bedrooms and square footage) into one array X = np.column_stack((bedrooms, square_footage)) y = house_prices.reshape(-1, 1) # Split the data into training and testing sets # Standardize the features # Create a regression model using TensorFlow and Keras # Input shape adjusted to the number of features # Output layer for regression # Compile the model for regression # Using MSE as the loss function # Train the model # Make predictions on the test set # Calculate the Mean Squared Error on the test set .

This highlights problems addressed and before and after changes. Additionally, a big portion of this review document discussess index.html and some of its key challenges. | Resize Images. This is a quick discussion of how I resized my images. They were large and it was causing characters to slow down. After resize, things are faster and my eye can not tell the difference. | Dynamic Screen Resizing. Tho figure out how to resize background and characters took a lot of time and a few lines of code that are show. | ClassIO Diagram. This document has worked well to determine objects. Though, there has been some additions as project continues. The laregest is managing Game Objects in GameObjectArray. This is shown in use in index.html in GameLoop and Resizing. | Migrating to OOP. This is a sample and test of scaling index.html to only do background. This could be a great starting point to using code from this project to migrate your own system. | . Overview of game control - index.html . Main game page (aka Game Controller). This has been an area of learning and rework. . HTML Elements . HTML canvas container html (&lt;div id=&quot;canvasContainer&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;. This is location where canvas elements are added to the DOM (background, dog, monkey, …). . Minima Layout. It is very important to know how a minima site works and layout files provided by a Theme. Everyting we do in the game is considered content in the minima layout. Thus, the game is content between GitHub Pages “header” and “footer”. . Minima Readme | Minima Layout | . &lt;!-- include head.html --&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;!-- include header.html --&gt; &lt;main class=&quot;page-content&quot; aria-label=&quot;Content&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;wrapper&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- content --&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/main&gt; &lt;!-- include footer.html --&gt; &lt;/body&gt; .

            "content": "Unit 7: ArrayList . Mastering the concept of Java’s ArrayList. AP Exam weighting: 2.5-7.5%. . 7.1: ArrayList Intro . ArrayLists are dynamic, meaning their size can grow or shrink as needed, but arrays are static in size | Instead of creating a new array of a different size and copying the data from the initial array to the new one, we can use ArrayLists | . Arrays ArrayLists . Fixed Length | Resizable Length | . Fundamental Java feature | Part of a framework | . An object with no methods | Class with many methods | . Not as flexible | Designed to be very flexible | . Can store primitive data | Not designed to store primitives | .   | Slightly slower than arrays | .   | Need an import statement | . In order to use the ArrayList class, the ArrayList class needs to be imported from the java util package. This can be done by writing import java.util.ArrayList at the top of the class file. . import java.util.ArrayList; // Import the ArrayList class // Declare and initialize an ArrayList of integers ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; numbersList = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); . ArrayList objects are created in the same fashion as other object classes. The primary difference with ArrayLists is that the element type of the ArrayList must be specified using angled bracket &lt;&gt;. In this example, E represents the data type that will be used in the ArrayList. This can be replaced by an object data type: . ArrayList&lt;E&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;E&gt;(); . We can actually declare ArrayLists without specifying the type that will be included in the ArrayList, but specifying the data type is smarter because it allows the compiler to find errors before run time, so its more efficient and easy to spot errors. . ArrayList list = new ArrayList(); . Quick lil popcorn hack . Create 2 ArrayLists, 1 called studentName and 1 called studentAge . public class Student { public static void main(String[] args) { //Initialize your ArrayLists } } . 7.2: ArrayList Methods . Learning Objectives . Students will be able to represent collections of related object reference data using ArrayList objects. . Essential Knowledge . Iteration statements provide a means to access all the elements stored within an ArrayList. This process is referred to as “traversing the ArrayList.” . | The following ArrayList methods, including what they do and when they are used, are part of the Java Quick Reference: . int size() - Returns the count of elements within the list. | boolean add(E obj) - Appends the object obj to the end of the list and returns true. | void add(int index, E obj) - Inserts obj at the specified index, shifting elements at and above that position to the right (incrementing their indices by 1) and increasing the list’s size by 1. | E get(int index) - Retrieves the element at the given index in the list. | E set(int index, E obj) - Replaces the element at the specified index with obj and returns the previous element at that index. | E remove(int index) - Deletes the element at the specified index, shifting all subsequent elements one index to the left, reducing the list’s size by one, and returning the removed element. | . | Java allows the generic ArrayList&lt;E&gt;, where the generic type E specifies the type of element. . | When ArrayList&lt;E&gt; is specified, the types of the reference parameters and return type when using the methods are type E. . | ArrayList&lt;E&gt; is preferred over ArrayList because it allows the compiler to find errors that would otherwise be found at runtime. . | . Size of the ArrayList . int size(); : Returns the number of elements in the list. | . Consider the following code: . ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; a1 = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); System.out.println(a1.size()); . 0 . Adding Items to an ArrayList . boolean add(E obj); : Appends obj to the end of the list and returns true. | void add(int index, E obj) : Inserts obj at position index, as long as index is within the list’s length. It moves each element in the list 1 index higher and adds 1 to the list’s size. | . Consider the following code: . ArrayList&lt;Double&gt; a2 = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); a2.add(1.0); a2.add(2.0); a2.add(3.0); a2.add(1, 4.0); System.out.println(a2); . [1.0, 4.0, 2.0, 3.0] . Let’s Look at an Example . Consider the following code: . ArrayList&lt;String&gt; h = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); h.add(&quot;Hello&quot;); h.add(&quot;Hello&quot;); h.add(&quot;HeLLO&quot;); h.add(&quot;Hello&quot;); h.add(1, &quot;Hola&quot;); h.add(26.2); h.add(new String(&quot;Hello&quot;)); h.add(false); . Now, consider this code: . ArrayList&lt;String&gt; g = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); g.add(&quot;Hello&quot;); g.add(&quot;Hello&quot;); g.add(&quot;HeLLO&quot;); g.add(&quot;Hello&quot;); g.add(1, &quot;Hola&quot;); g.add(new String(&quot;Hello&quot;)); System.out.println(g); . [Hello, Hola, Hello, HeLLO, Hello, Hello] . Question: Why does this code work? . Deleting Items from an ArrayList . E remove(int index) : Removes the element at position index, and moves the elements at position index + 1 and higher to the left. It also subtracts one from the list’s size. The return value is the element formerly at position index. . // If you are confused of what list g is, look back at the previous code. g.remove(3); String former = g.remove(0); System.out.println(former); . Hello . Updating Items in an ArrayList . E set(int index, E obj) : Replaces the element at position index with obj and returns the element formerly at position index. . String helloFormer = g.set(1, &quot;Bonjour&quot;); System.out.println(helloFormer); System.out.println(g); . Hello [Hola, Bonjour, Hello, Hello] . Accessing Items in an ArrayList . E get(int index) Returns the element at position index in the list. . String hello = g.get(3); System.out.println(hello); System.out.println(g); . Hello [Hola, Bonjour, Hello, Hello] . Passing an ArrayList as a Method Parameter . The only time that it is wise to use ArrayList instead of ArrayList&lt;E&gt; is when it is as a function parameter and it is only using ArrayList&lt;&gt;.get(E) or ArrayList&lt;&gt;.size(). Consider the following code: . private void accessOnly(ArrayList arr) { if (arr.size() &gt; 0) { System.out.println(arr.get(0)); // Change the index to the one you want to access } else { System.out.println(&quot;Array is empty&quot;); } } ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; myList = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;(); accessOnly(myList); . Array is empty . Returning an ArrayList from a Method . In order for you to return an ArrayList, the data type must be specified, and the return type must be the same as the return value. Consider the following code: . private ArrayList&lt;String&gt; returnTheSame() { ArrayList&lt;String&gt; arr = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;(); // Initialize the ArrayList arr.add(&quot;Hello&quot;); return arr; } ArrayList&lt;String&gt; result = returnTheSame(); System.out.println(result); . [Hello] . Hacks . The learning objective is that “Students will be able to represent collections of related object reference data using ArrayList objects.” What does this mean to you? . | Answer the following questions: . Look back at Size of the ArrayList. What does the code output and why? | Look back at Adding items to an ArrayList. What does the code output and why? What type of function is void, and what will be the return value? | Look back at Example 1. What two lines did we remove? Why? | If an ArrayList is being used as a parameter, what are the only two methods I can use from it? What would happen if I tried to use any other methods? | . | Using the Hack Helper, write code that will: . Add 2 items to the list. | Remove an item from the list anywhere of the user’s choice. | Replace am item anywhere in the list of the user’s choice. | Get the first and last element of the list, no matter the length. | Return the items added, removed, replaced, and the list’s size, in one string. | . | . Hack Helper . public class ArrayListMethodsExample { private String manipulateList(/* You can put parameters here if you want to... */) { // Your code here } public static void main(String[] args) { ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; nums = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); ArrayListMethodsExample example = new ArrayListMethodsExample(); String output = example.manipulateList(); System.out.println(output); } } . 7.3: Traversing Arraylists . Learning Objectives: . With an Arraylist you can traverse objects using a for or while loop. . | Traversing objects is similar to iterating through objects. . | . Essential Knowledge: . Iteration statements can be used to accsess all the elements in an Arraylist. This is called traversing the Arraylist. . | Deleting elements during a traversal of an Arraylist requires special techniques to avoid skiping elements. This is called traversing the Arraylist. . | The indicies of an Arraylist start at 0; If you try to use any value lower than 0, you will get an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException error . | . import java.util.ArrayList; import java.util.List; public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { ArrayList&lt;String&gt; roster = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); roster.add(&quot;Hello&quot;); roster.add(&quot;World&quot;); roster.add(&quot;Java&quot;); int sum = 0; for (int i = 0; i &lt; roster.size(); i++) { String element = roster.get(i); if (element != null) { sum += element.length(); } } System.out.println(sum); } } . Breakdown: . We are first declaring a new arraylist and adding a few elements. . | Next, we set the “sum” variable as 0. . | We set a for loop to traverse through the arraylist, iterating through all the indices in the arraylist and adding up the lengths of all the values. . | Lastly, we print it out. . | . Loop Conditions: . There are a few diffrent loop conditions you can use to traverse an Arraylist: | . First, there are three major parts of a for loop: Initialisation, in which you declare the index, can be modified to change where you want to traverse from. . Boolean condition, in which you declare the stop condition, can be modified in order to change the index you want to stop traversing in. . Update, in which you declare how many indexes to go through, can be modified to skip certain indicies and traverse in a certain direction. . Practice: . Suppose we have an arraylist named grades, and we want to remove the entries that are lower than 70. replace the question marks with code to solve the problem: . import java.util.ArrayList; import java.util.List; public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { ArrayList&lt;int&gt; grades = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); grades.add(68.9); grades.add(71); grades.add(100); grades.add(80); for(int i = 0; i&lt;???; i???){ if(grades.get(i)&lt;70){ ??? } } System.out.println(grades); } } . Using Enhanced For-Loop With Traversing: . Using Enhanced for loop is easier to read and write and is also more concise and avoids errors. . | Indexes are not explicitly used and copies of the current element are made at each iteration. . | . import java.util.ArrayList; import java.util.List; public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { List&lt;String&gt; roster = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); roster.add(&quot;Hello&quot;); roster.add(&quot;World&quot;); roster.add(&quot;Java&quot;); // Using an enhanced for loop to iterate through the ArrayList for (String element : roster) { System.out.println(element); } } } . Common mistakes: . Using the Wrong Data Type: Ensure that you declare your ArrayList with the correct data type. Using the wrong data type can lead to type mismatches and errors. . | Incorrect Indexing: Be cautious when using a standard for loop. Off-by-one errors or accessing elements that don’t exist can lead to runtime exceptions. . | Modifying the List During Iteration: Modifying an ArrayList (adding or removing elements) while iterating over it can lead to a ConcurrentModificationException. To avoid this, use an Iterator or create a copy of the list if modifications are needed. . | Not Checking for Null Elements: When using enhanced for loops or iterators, check for null elements if there’s a possibility that your list contains them to avoid NullPointerExceptions. . | Inefficient Searching: If you need to find a specific element, avoid using a linear search within a loop. Use appropriate methods like contains() or indexOf() to find elements efficiently. . | . Hacks: . Create a scenario which requires the use of arraylist traversal and create code to solve it. | Extra points to creative scenarios | 90% credit to any working code and scenario | 80% credit to incomplete code if you provide explanation of it | -10% deduction for late submition | . 7.4: Developing Algorithms Using ArrayLists . Learning Objectives . In the context of ArrayList objects, this module aims to teach the following skills: . a. Iterating through ArrayLists using for or while loops. . b. Iterating through ArrayLists using enhanced for loops. . In the realm of algorithms, within the context of specific requirements that demand the utilization of ArrayList traversals, students will be able to: . Recognize established algorithms. | Customize existing algorithms. | Create new algorithms. | . Essential Knowledge . Iteration statements provide a means to access all the elements stored within an ArrayList. This process is referred to as “traversing the ArrayList.” . | The following methods related to ArrayLists, their functions, and appropriate use are covered in the Java Quick Reference: . int size() - Returns the count of elements within the list. | boolean add(E obj) - Appends the object obj to the end of the list and returns true. | void add(int index, E obj) - Inserts obj at the specified index, shifting elements at and above that position to the right (incrementing their indices by 1) and increasing the list’s size by 1. | E get(int index) - Retrieves the element at the given index in the list. | E set(int index, E obj) - Replaces the element at the specified index with obj and returns the previous element at that index. | E remove(int index) - Deletes the element at the specified index, shifting all subsequent elements one index to the left, reducing the list’s size by one, and returning the removed element. | . | There exist established algorithms for ArrayLists that make use of traversals to: . Insert elements. | Remove elements. | Apply the same algorithms commonly used with 1D arrays. | . | . Popcorn Hacks: . Before you uncomment the code and run it, guess what the code will do based on what you’ve learned. . Let’s Look at an Example (Example 1) . public class ArrayListExample { private double findMax(double[] values) { // double max = values[0]; //for (int index = 1; index &lt; values.length; index++) { // if (values[index] &gt; max) { // max = values[index]; // } //} // return max; } public static void main(String[] args) { double[] nums = {1.0, 3.0, 2.0, 2.0, 1.0, 69.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 2.0, 5.0, 10.0}; ArrayListExample example = new ArrayListExample(); double max = example.findMax(nums); System.out.println(&quot;Maximum value: &quot; + max); } } ArrayListExample.main(null); . Take a closer look at the findMax() method. It takes in a list of doubles as parameters. It will then use a for loop to find the maximum value in the list. Now, using what we know, can we replace the list of doubles with an ArrayList of Doubles? We sure can! Take a look at how we can use ArrayList to do just that: . public class ArrayListExample { private double findMax(ArrayList&lt;Double&gt; values) { // double max = values.get(0); //for (int index = 1; index &lt; values.size(); index++) { // if (values.get(index) &gt; max) { // max = values.get(index); // } //} //return max; } public static void main(String[] args) { ArrayList&lt;Double&gt; nums = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); nums.add(1.0); nums.add(3.0); nums.add(2.0); nums.add(2.0); nums.add(1.0); nums.add(69.0); nums.add(2.0); nums.add(4.0); nums.add(6.0); nums.add(2.0); nums.add(5.0); nums.add(10.0); ArrayListExample example = new ArrayListExample(); double max = example.findMax(nums); System.out.println(&quot;Maximum value: &quot; + max); } } ArrayListExample.main(null); . Let’s Look at an Example (Example 2) . Take a look at this code: . public class ArrayListExample { private int findMin(int[] values) { //int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE; //for (int currentValue : values) { // if (currentValue &lt; min) { // min = currentValue; // } //} return min; } public static void main(String[] args) { int[] nums = {420, 703, 2034, 582, 1047, 4545}; ArrayListExample example = new ArrayListExample(); int min = example.findMin(nums); System.out.println(&quot;Minimum value: &quot; + min); } } ArrayListExample.main(null); . Now, can we use ArrayLists to make this code better? We sure can! Take a look at the new and improved code that uses ArrayLists: . public class ArrayListExample { private int findMin(ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; values) { //int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE; //for (int currentValue : values) { // if (currentValue &lt; min) { // min = currentValue; // } //} return min; } public static void main(String[] args) { ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; nums = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); nums.add(420); nums.add(703); nums.add(2034); nums.add(582); nums.add(1047); nums.add(4545); ArrayListExample example = new ArrayListExample(); int min = example.findMin(nums); System.out.println(&quot;Minimum value: &quot; + min); } } ArrayListExample.main(null); . Hacks . Answer the questions: Look back at the examples. What’s similar? What’s different? | Why do we use ArrayList? Why not just regular lists? | . | Demonstrate at least two ArrayList methods that aren’t ArrayList&lt;&gt;.size() and ArrayList&lt;&gt;.get(). | Write the method findSum() using the Hack Helper and incorporating ArrayList. | . Hack Helper . public class ArrayListHacks { private int findSum(ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; values) { // Your code here return 0; } public static void main(String[] args) { ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; nums = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); nums.add(0); nums.add(1); nums.add(2); nums.add(3); nums.add(5); nums.add(8); ArrayListHacks hacks = new ArrayListHacks(); hacks.findSum(nums); } } ArrayListHacks.main(null); . 7.5 Searching . Learning Objectives . Apply sequential/linear search algorithms to search for specific information in array or arraylist objects | . Essential Knowledge: . Sequential/linear search alogorithms check each element in order untill the desired value is found or all elementsin the array or arraylist have been checked | . Search Process . Linear searching fits a standard for loop perfectly! We need to specify each element, one at a time, and do not need to track the index after execution . | Inside the for loop, we retrieve the value from the structure at the specified index and compare it to the searched value . | If it matches we return the index, otherwise we keep looking! . | . Searching Linear Structures . Finding information with a computer is something we need to know how to do. Linear search algorithms are BEST used when we do not have any idea about the order of the data and so we need to look at each element to determine if what we are looking for is in fact inside the array or ArrayList. . When searching, we do need to remember that different data types require comparisons! . When looking at int values, the == operator is the tool to use! | When searching for a double value, we need to make sure the value is close enough by doing some math! | Object instances should always use the .equals(otheThing) method to check for a match! | . Searching an ArrayList of Double . public int where(double magicNumber, ArrayList&lt;Double&gt; realNumbers, double delta) { for (int index = 0; index &lt; realNumbers.size(); index++) { if (Math.abs(magicNumber - realNumbers.get(index)) &lt; delta) { return index; } } return -1; } . Explanation . The where function searches through a list of numbers to find and return the position of the first number that is very close to a specific target number, known as magicNumber. If no number in the list is close enough to the target number, the function returns -1, indicating that no match was found. . Searching an ArrayList of book for a String . public int findTheWord(String searchedPhrase, ArrayList&lt;Book&gt; myBooks) { for (int index = 0; index &lt; myBooks.size(); index++) { Book currentBook = myBooks.get(index); String currentPhrase = currentBook.getDescription(); if(currentPhrase.equals(searchedPhrase)) { return index; } } return -1; } . Explanation . This little code snippet is like a treasure hunt through a collection of books; it’s on a mission to find the one book whose description matches exactly with a special phrase you’re looking for. If it finds the perfect match, it’ll excitedly tell you where it is in the collection, but if not, it’ll sadly let you know with a -1 that the search was a bust. . Questions . Should we use == when looking for an Object? . No, that only will return true if the variable and the element stored at that index point to the same memory, are aliases of each other . Why did we subtract the double values? . To make sure that the lack of preciosin that is inherit in the data type is handled within our code . Why does order sometimes matter? . When searching for a value to remove from a list, if we search forward we have to make sure to adjust the loop control variable, or we might skip what we are looking for when removing! . 7.6 Sorting . Learning Objectives . Apply selection sort and insertion sort algorithms to sort the elements of array or ArrayList objects. | . Essential Knowledge: . Selection sort and insertion sort are iterative sorting algorithms that can be used to sort elements in an array or ArrayList. | . Selection Sort . This is one of the easiest sorts to demonstrate. The selection sort identifies either the maximum or minimum of the compared values and iterates over the structure checking if the item stored at the index matches that condition, if so, it will swap the value stored at that index and continue. This implementation uses a helper method to perform the swap operation since variables can hold only one value at a time! . Example: . // with normal arrays for (int outerLoop = 0; outerLoop &lt; myDucks.length; outerLoop ++) { int minIndex = outerLoop; for (int inner = outerLoop +1; inner &lt; myDucks.length; inner++) { if (myDucks[inner].compareT(myDucks[minIndex]) &lt; 0) { minIndex = inner; } } if (minIndex != outerLoop) { swapItems(minIndex, outerloop, myDucks); } } // with array lists for (int outerLoop = 0; outerLoop &lt; myDucks.size(); outerLoop++) { int minIndex = outerLoop; for (int inner = outerLoop + 1; inner &lt; myDucks.size(); inner++) { if (myDucks.get(inner).compareT(myDucks.get(minIndex)) &lt; 0) { minIndex = inner; } } if (minIndex != outerLoop) { swapItems(minIndex, outerLoop, myDucks); } } /* This code performs a selection sort on the myDucks ArrayList, ordering its elements based on the compareT method. During each iteration of the outer loop, it finds the index of the minimum element in the unsorted portion of the list and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted portion. */ . Insertion Sort Algorithm . The insertion sort is characterized by building a sorted structure as it proceeds. It inserts each value it finds at the appropriate location in the data structure. This is often accomplished by using a while loop as the inner loop. . Example: . for (int outer = 1; outer &lt; randomList.size(); outer++) { DebugDuck tested = randomList.get(outer); int inner = outer -1; while ( innter &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; tested.compareTo(randomList.get(inner)) &lt; 0) { ramdomList.set(inner +1, randomList.get(inner)); inner--; } randomList.set(inner +1, tested) } // This code arranges a list of DebugDuck objects in order using the insertion sort method, // by moving through the list and putting each item in its proper place one by one. . 7.7: Ethical Issues around Data Collection . Learning Objectives: . Explaining the risks of privacy from collecting and storing personal data on computer systems. | . Essential Knowledge: . When using the computer, personal privacy is at risk. Programmers should attempt to safeguard personal privacy. | . Privacy Protection: . A simple way to protect privacy is to delete personal user info after done using it. | Another way is to minimize the amount of data used by the program in order to protect privacy. | Anonymizing personal data via the object method hashCode() is another way. | . Hacks: . Think of other ways to safeguard user privacy (any other method not listed is fine) | Extra points to creative solutions | 90% credit to any solution | 80% credit to incomplete solution (how did you do that?) | -10% deduction for late submition | .

For the most part, algorithms in ArrayLists and arrays are very similar. | . Popcorn Hacks . Find the maximum, minimum, and sum of an ArrayList. . public static void main(String[] args) { ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; arr = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); arr.add(1); arr.add(7); arr.add(9); arr.add(80); arr.add(13); arr.add(3); arr.add(7); arr.add(8); arr.add(2); arr.add(16); } . 7.5 Searching . Searching in an ArrayList allows you to find an element, if it exists, an index is returned | All that is needed to search any linear structure is a standard for loop and if block | Typically, if the element is not found then -1 is returned, however a boolean value can also be used | . Example of Linear Search . import java.util.ArrayList; public class LinearSearch { public static int linearSearch(ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; list, int target) { for (int i = 0; i &lt; list.size(); i++) { if (list.get(i) == target) { return i; // return index of target element if found } } return -1; // return -1 if the target element is not in the array } public static void main(String[] args) { ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; numbers = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); numbers.add(5); numbers.add(10); numbers.add(15); numbers.add(20); numbers.add(25); int target = 15; // target of search int result = linearSearch(numbers, target); if (result != -1) { System.out.println(target + &quot; found at index &quot; + result); } else { System.out.println(target + &quot; not found in the ArrayList.&quot;); } } } LinearSearch.main(null); . The linear search algorithm searches for a specific target value (15 in this example) within the ArrayList by iterating through its elements one by one | It checks if the element at the current index (list.get(i)) is equal to the target value | If a match is found, the index is returned; else, it continues the loop until the end of the ArrayList is reached | .

Finish the code below, write code that checks if favoriteFlavor is in chipsBag | Using a loop, print a message saying if favoriteFlavor is in the bag | . import java.util.ArrayList; import java.util.Scanner; public class FavoriteChip { public static void main(String[] args) { ArrayList&lt;String&gt; chipsBag = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in); chipsBag.add(&quot;BBQ&quot;); chipsBag.add(&quot;Cheddar&quot;); chipsBag.add(&quot;Salt and Pepper&quot;); System.out.print(&quot;Enter your favorite chip flavor: &quot;); String favoriteFlavor = scanner.nextLine(); // implement your own search logic here } } FavoriteChip.main(null); . 7.6 Sorting . There are 2 main sorting algorithms that Collegeboard focuses on, selection sort and insertion sort | . Selection sort . Selection sort divides the ArrayList into two “subarrays,” the first is sorted and the second is unsorted. | Selection sort is easy to implement and is useful for sorting through small datasets. | . Example of Selection sort . import java.util.ArrayList; public class SelectionSort { public static void main(String[] args) { ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; arrayList = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); arrayList.add(64); arrayList.add(25); arrayList.add(12); arrayList.add(22); arrayList.add(11); selectionSort(arrayList); System.out.println(&quot;Sorted ArrayList: &quot; + arrayList); } public static void selectionSort(ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; arr) { int n = arr.size(); for (int i = 0; i &lt; n - 1; i++) { int minIndex = i; for (int j = i + 1; j &lt; n; j++) { if (arr.get(j) &lt; arr.get(minIndex)) { minIndex = j; } } // Swap the found minimum element with the element at index i int temp = arr.get(i); arr.set(i, arr.get(minIndex)); arr.set(minIndex, temp); } } } SelectionSort.main(null); . Start with an ArrayList, [64, 25, 12, 22, 11] . | We want to arrange these numbers in order from smallest to largest, like [11, 12, 22, 25, 64] . | selectionSort starts at the beginning of the list and looks for the smallest number in the whole list. In this case, it’s 11 . | It swaps 11 with the first number in the list (which is 64) so that 11 comes first . | Now, the list looks like [11, 25, 12, 22, 64] . | The function repeats this process for the remaining numbers, finding the next smallest (which is 12) and putting it in the second position . | This continues until all numbers are in order . | The final sorted list is [11, 12, 22, 25, 64] . | . Insertion Sort . In insertion sort, we assume that the first element is already sorted | The second element is then taken and is either inserted before the first element or kept in place to make the first 2 elements sorted | Insertion sort is adaptive as it does not need to perform as many comparisons and swaps as selection sort. If you expect the data to be partially ordered, insertion sort is the better option. | . Example of Insertion Sort . import java.util.ArrayList; public class InsertionSort { public static void insertionSort(ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; arr) { int n = arr.size(); for (int i = 1; i &lt; n; i++) { int key = arr.get(i); int j = i - 1; // Move elements of arr[0..i-1] that are greater than key // to one position ahead of their current position while (j &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; arr.get(j) &gt; key) { arr.set(j + 1, arr.get(j)); j = j - 1; } arr.set(j + 1, key); } } public static void main(String[] args) { ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; arrayList = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); arrayList.add(12); arrayList.add(11); arrayList.add(13); arrayList.add(5); arrayList.add(6); System.out.println(&quot;Original ArrayList: &quot; + arrayList); insertionSort(arrayList); System.out.println(&quot;Sorted ArrayList: &quot; + arrayList); } } InsertionSort.main(null); . Start with an ArrayList of numbers, [12, 11, 13, 5, 6] . | We want to arrange these numbers in order from smallest to largest, like [5, 6, 11, 12, 13] . | insertionSort starts with the second element (11) . | It compares 11 to the elements on its left. It finds that 11 is smaller than 12, so it shifts 12 one position to the right to make space for 11 . | The ArrayList now looks like [11, 12, 13, 5, 6] . | The function repeats this process for each element in the list. It moves 13 to the right place and then 5 and 6 . | After sorting all the elements, the ArrayList is now sorted in ascending order: [5, 6, 11, 12, 13] . | . 7.6 Popcorn Hack . Given an ArrayList of String objects, sort the following ArrayLists on ascending order of word length. . 1) . import java.util.ArrayList; public class SortByLength { public static void main(String[] args) { ArrayList&lt;String&gt; words = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); // creating new arraylist // adding words to the list words.add(&quot;theater&quot;); words.add(&quot;connection&quot;); words.add(&quot;seasonal&quot;); words.add(&quot;feast&quot;); words.add(&quot;meeting&quot;); // add code for sorting by length here } } SortByLength.main(null); . 2) . import java.util.ArrayList; import java.util.Collections; import java.util.Comparator; class Student { String name; double gpa; public Student(String name, double gpa) { this.name = name; this.gpa = gpa; } } public class SortByGPA { public static void main (String[] args) { ArrayList&lt;Student&gt; students = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); // creating new arraylist to store student objects // add student objects to ArrayList // write code for sorting here } } SortByGPA.main(null); . 7.7 Ethical Issues Around Data Collection . When collecting data in a Java program, data security is VERY IMPORTANT. This involves any program that deals with . Necessary personal information | Information that is associated with results | . Removing Data . When collected data is no longer needed, be sure to remove the information from your application | Removal of unnecessary data reduces risk of data breaches and protects sensitive information from unauthorized access | . Anonymizing Data . When collecting user information, avoid asking for private information to identify users ie. phone numbers, social security numbers, etc. | . Collegeboard Example . Scanner inputScanner = new Scanner(System.in); String fullName = inputScanner.nextLine(); // implementation of code int identifier = fullName.hashCode(); fullName = null; // further implementation . In this example… . The user would type their full name in which it is used in the program | After, the identifier equates to the hash value of the original string and the fullName is set to null | Using the hash value instead of the actual name adds a degree of anonymity for the user | Turning the fullName to null also indicates that the code no longer needs to store the name of the user | . This minimizes the possible impact of the data by reducing the likelihood of unintentional exposure of the user’s name within the program. . Hacks for Unit 7 . Complete all questions and popcorn hacks | Write a Java program that creates an ArrayList of integers. Create methods for adding, removing, setting, getting, etc numbers and also sort the list. Then, utilize user input to determine which methods will actually be run and enable the user to also determine the specific index that a number will be added, removed. | . Challenge .

The procedure is currently just called “procedure.” It compares the current grade with the existing quiz grade and replaces the original score if the current is higher. . def procedure(quiz_grade, current_points, total_points): # calculate current grade current_grade = (current_points / total_points) * 100 if current_grade &gt; quiz_grade: quiz_grade = current_grade return quiz_grade quiz_grade = 85 # Initial quiz grade current_points = 90 # Current points earned total_points = 100 # Total points for the quiz new_quiz_grade = procedure(quiz_grade, current_points, total_points) print(f&quot;Old quiz grade: {quiz_grade}&quot;) print(f&quot;New quiz grade: {new_quiz_grade}&quot;) . Function Parameters . A function can have one or more parameters that can be passed into the function as local variables to use in the procedural function. The variables that can be passed in the function are called parameters. The data passed in when the function is called are called arguments. . Parameters: input values of a procedure . Arguments: specify the parameter values when a procedure is called . def triangle_area(length, width): # parameters passed in two variables: length and width, returns area area = 1/2 * length * width # calculates area from the length and width print(&quot;length:&quot;, length) print(&quot;width:&quot;, width) return area # returns area # examples print(triangle_area(3, 4)) # the arguments here are 3 and 4, which becomes the parameters length and width respectively print(triangle_area(6, 8)) print(triangle_area(12, 89)) . Procedure Algorithm / How Procedures Work . Remember that procedures are essentially a set of programming instructions, or lines of code, that accomplish a goal. When executed, each line of code is executed in order (step after step after step) to get to the goal. . Regular code/Python . # Procedure called &quot;applyTax&quot; that applies a percent tax to a price def applyTax(price, percentTax): # When writing a procedure, first decide what parameters you will need to accomplish your goal # Step 1: Calculate the amount taxed taxAmount = price * percentTax/100 # Step 2: Add the amount taxed to the price to get the end amount endAmount = price + taxAmount return endAmount # Use procedure to apply a 50% tax to a price of $10 cost = applyTax(10, 50) print(cost) . CollegeBoard Pseudo-Code . Note that the pseudo-code below has the exact same purpose as the actual code above. Ignore the breaks and spaces since they are used for formatting. Differences between prseudo-code and Python: . | Pseudo-code uses “PROCEDURE” instead of “def” | Pseudo-code uses “&lt;–” instead of “=” | Pseudo-code uses “{}” instead of “:” to mark where a procedure starts and ends | . Pseudo-code example . PROCEDURE applyTax (price, percentTax) {     taxAmount &lt;– price * percentTax/100     endAmount &lt;– price + taxAmount     return endAmount } . Hack 2: Robot Pseudo-Code . . Instructions: . The blue triangle represents a robot that moves in a grid of squares. The tip of the triangle indicates where the robot is facing. | Write a procedure that allows the robot to make a detour around a block by moving to the left. | . Commands . MOVE_FORWARD() - Moves the robot forward one square | MOVE_BACKWARD() - Moves the robot backward one square | ROTATE_LEFT() - Rotates the robot 90 degrees left | ROTATE_RIGHT() - Rotates the robot 90 degrees right | . Your code here: . Procedure Return Values . When a procedure is run, it executes a series of calculations or commands and at some point and needs to provide a useful result. The return statement is what allows us to return a useful value back to the calling code. The returns statement can return various types of values such as booleans, integers, strings, etc. . Procedure Calls . Calling: This involves specifying the function name followed by parentheses, and passing any required arguments inside the parentheses. . When a function is called, the program control jumps to the function definition, and the statements inside the function are executed. After the function completes its task, the control returns to the point where the function was called. . Hack 3: Create and Call a Procedure . Define a function named calculate_grade that takes a student’s score as a parameter and returns ‘Pass’ if the score is 50 or more, and ‘Fail’ otherwise. . # your code here . Homework . Instructions . There are two total problems: . An easy regular code (Python) problem | A medium pseudo-code problem | A hard regular code (Python) problem | Completing question 1 and 2 gets you 0.9/1 if you do it correctly. Completing/attempting question 3, adding creativity, and adding good comments will potentially raise you above 0.9. . Question 1 . Write a procedure to apply a percent discount to a set price. See the example about applying tax if you’re stuck. . # your code here . Question 2 . Create your own robot problem! Include a picture with a square grid to represent the map and triangle to represent the robot. Add a flag to a square to represent the end-point and a shaded-in block to represent a detour. Write a procedure in pseudo-code to move the robot from the start, past the detour, and to the end point. . Add your image here by adding the link between the “” and removing the comment formatting: . # your code here . Question 3 . Create a program that asks for user input of an integer n, and return an array that contains all the prime numbers up to the number n (inclusive). Remember to use multiple different functions to better organize the code and increase efficiency. . def primes(n): # your code here # tests print(primes(5)) print(primes(12)) print(primes(35)) .",

            "content": "3.12 Parts of a Procedure: . Vocab . Procedure- A named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values They are referred to by different names, such as method or function, depending on the programming language . Parameter- input value of a procedure. Arguments specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called . A Procedure call- interrupts the sequential execution of statements, causing the program to execute the statements wtithin the procedure before continuing . Once the last statement in the proceed has been executed, flow of control is returned to the point immediately following where procedure was called. . A procedure is a group of programming instructions. They’re also known as methods or functions, depending on the programming language. You can use a procedure to use the same set of instructions, again and again, without having to rewrite it into your code.In AP Pseudocode, here’s how they’ll represent procedures: . first_number = 5 second_number = 7 sum_value = first_number + second_number print (sum_value) . It goes without saying that, if you wanted to sum more than one set of numbers at a time, you’d have to rewrite these lines over and over again… . Let’s see how we’d go about writing this as a function, or a procedure in Python. . A function in Python looks like this: . def name_of_function (parameter1, parameter2): #code statements here . So our summing machine would look like this! . def summing_machine(first_number, second_number): print (first_number + second_number) . When you call a procedure, your program acts like those lines of code are written out. Once it’s done executing those code lines, your program goes back to reading code sequentially. . When you call that procedure with defined values or variables, those values are known as arguments. . def summing_machine(first_number, second_number): print (first_number + second_number) summing_machine(5, 7) #In this example, 5 and 7 are examples of arguments. . For example: . def summing_machine(first_number, second_number): value = first_number + second_number return (value) answer = summing_machine(5, 7) print (answer) #you can use this to manipulate the value the function returns as well. print (answer + 1) . LETS LOOK AT AN EXAMPLE: . In this example this is a simple procedure to create a code for calculating the area . # Define the calculate_area procedure def calculate_area(length, width): # Calculate the area here area = length * width return area # Call the procedure with different values length1 = 5 width1 = 3 area1 = calculate_area(length1, width1) # Print the results print(f&quot;The area of the first rectangle is {area1}&quot;) . The area of the first rectangle is 15 . Popcorn Hack 1 . a) Define Return Values and Output Parameters in your own words: . b )Code a procedure that finds the square root of any given . Answers . a return value basically returns whatever the program is running, which means that it keeps the program running. Output parameters are, I think, the values that the program exits, or outputs. So whatever is printed . x = 64 def sqrt(x): value = x**0.5 return value answer = sqrt(x) . Calling Procedures Quiz . Practice AP mq questions from collageboard: . 1 In Python, what can be done by a value returned by a procedure? . a. Define input variables for another procedure . b. Print it to console . c. Call another procedure with it . d. Assign it to a variable or use it in expressions . 2. When a Procedure is called, what happens to the programs execution? . a. it prints the result of the procedure . b. it exits the program and terminates execution . c. it moves to the next line of code in the program . d. it acts as if the lines of code on the procedure are written out . 3 Which of the following is an example of a procedural call in Python? . a. def summing_machine(first_number, second_number) . b. summing_machine(5, 7) . c. print(first_number + second_number) . d. return(value) . 3.13 Developing Procedures and Procedural Abstraction . Procedures are an example of abstraction. . (In fact, it’s part of a special form of abstraction known as procedural abstraction.) . This is because you can call a procedure without knowing how it works. A common built-in procedure in programming languages is the print() procedure. . Procedures allow you to solve a large problem based on the solution to smaller sub-problems. . Popcorn Hack #1 . Simplify code to make the output be one value that gets printed . firstnum = 1 secondnum = 2 thirdnum = 3 fourthnum = 4 print(firstnum, secondnum, thirdnum, fourthnum) . 1 2 3 4 . Answer . firstnum = 1 secondnum = 2 thirdnum = 3 fourthnum = 4 print(firstnum) . 1 . When you divide a computer program into separate sub-programs, it’s known as modularity. Procedures can also help you simplify your code and improve its readability. Instead of this: . first_number = 7 second_number = 5 sum_value = first_number + second_number print (sum_value) first_number = 8 second_number = 2 sum_value = first_number + second_number print (sum_value) first_number = 9 second_number = 3 sum_value = first_number + second_number print (sum_value) . 12 10 12 . you get this: . def summing_machine(first_number, second_number): sum_value = first_number + second_number print (sum_value) summing_machine(5, 7) summing_machine(8, 2) summing_machine(9, 3) . 12 10 12 . This is especially important in larger programs, where you might already be looking at hundreds of lines of code. . Procedures can be reused. Parameters usually represent general categories of data, such as numbers or strings. . This means you could use one procedure for a wide range of individual scenarios. . Remember that placing a return statement inside a procedure will cause an immediate return from the procedure back to where the procedure is called. . The return statement may appear at any point inside the procedure. . Procedural abstraction also allows programmers the flexibility to modify or fix procedures without affecting the whole program, as long as the procedure continues to function in the same way. . Furthermore, they can make a change or edit once, in the procedure, and it will be implemented everywhere the procedure is called. . Popcorn Hack #2: create a Python program that generates multiplication tables for a specific number up to a specified limit. . def generate_multiplication_table(number, limit): &quot;&quot;&quot; Generates a multiplication table for the given number up to the specified limit. :param number: The number for which to generate the table. :param limit: The upper limit of the table (e.g., how far the multiplication will go). &quot;&quot;&quot; print(f&quot;Multiplication Table for {number} (Up to {limit}): n&quot;) for i in range(1, limit + 1): result = number * i print(f&quot;{number} x {i} = {result}&quot;) # Usage generate_multiplication_table(5, 10) . Multiplication Table for 5 (Up to 10): 5 x 1 = 5 5 x 2 = 10 5 x 3 = 15 5 x 4 = 20 5 x 5 = 25 5 x 6 = 30 5 x 7 = 35 5 x 8 = 40 5 x 9 = 45 5 x 10 = 50 . Anatomy of Python Classes . Class Definition: Classes are defined using the class keyword, followed by the class name, and a colon. . The class body is indented beneath the class definition. . class MyClass: # class body Pass . Attributes: These are variables that belong to a class. . They can be accessed using the dot notation on an instance of the class. . class MyClass: def __init__(self, attribute1, attribute2): self.attribute1 = attribute1 self.attribute2 = attribute2 . Methods: These are functions that are defined within a class. . They can perform specific operations on the object or modify its attributes. . class MyClass: def my_method(self): # method body pass . Constructor: The init method is a constructor in Python classes. . It is called when an object is created and allows the class to initialize the object’s attributes. . class MyClass: def __init__(self, attribute1, attribute2): self.attribute1 = attribute1 self.attribute2 = attribute2 . Self: It represents the instance of the class and is used to access the class’s attributes and methods. . class MyClass: def my_method(self): print(self.attribute1) . Homework . 1) Write a Python function called procedural_abstraction that demonstrates procedural abstraction by performing a specific task. Your function should take at least one parameter and return a result. 2) Write a Python function called summing_machine that takes two parameters, first_number and second_number, and returns the sum of these numbers.

Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a versatile plotting library for creating 2D and 3D visualizations and figures in Python, enabling a wide range of plots, charts, and graphs for data visualization and analysis. . Libraries are, at their heart, a collection of other people’s code, and it would be difficult to understand how the procedures should be used without documentation. APIs explain how two separate pieces of software interact with each other, and they also need documentation to keep this communication going. . Popcorn Hack 1 . We have now hopefully all done or seen this type of question about getting a robot from point a to point b. But this can be very tedious because it may take a lot of code to do that. Luckily, there’s a saving grace called procedures, procedures essentially shorten the amount of code that is needed. So for a robot example we have displayed, we will use the procedure “moveBackwards” to shorten the amount of code we would normally need. This will rotate our triangle 180 degrees. Here is the example and solution . #Code goes here .

What are some of the benefits of using an enhanced for loop in this case versus a regular for loop? . Limitations to enhanced for loop . it does not provide access to the index of the current element. This means you cannot easily determine the position of the element in the array or collection. | But when you want to search for a specific element in a collection and you don’t necessarily need to access the index | If you need to work with indices, you should use a traditional for loop instead. | . | read-only access to elements. You cannot modify the elements within the loop | Thus, when you need to modify a collection based on a condition. You should use a regular for loop | . | . For the next two code blocks, decide whether or not its better to use a regular for loop or an enhanced one, explain why. write the code for them . Searching for an Element in an ArrayList | ArrayList&lt;String&gt; names = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); String searchName = &quot;Vivian&quot;; //code goes here for () { } . Removing Even Numbers from an ArrayList | ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; numbers = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); //code goes here for () { } . 6.4: Developing Algorithms Using Arrays (Isabelle) . How to identify the maximum or minimum value in an array . It is a common task to determine what the largest or smallest value stored is inside an array. In order to do this, we need a method that can take a parameter of an array of primitve values (int or double) and return the item that is at the appropriate extreme. . Inside the method a local variable is needed to store the current max or min value that will be compared against all the values in the array. You can assign the current value to be either the opposite extreme or the first item you would be looking at. . You can use either a standard for loop or an enhanced for loop to determine the max or min. Assign the temporary variable a starting value based on what extreme you are searching for. . Inside the for loop, compare the current value against the local variable; if the current value is better, assign it to the temporary variable. When the loop is over, the local variable will contain the appropriate value and is still available and within scope and can be returned from the method. . Find max in an array of double values . private double findMax(double [] values) { double max = values[0]; for (int index = 1; index &lt; values.length; index++) { if (values[index] &gt; max) { max = values[index]; } } return max; } . Find min in an array of int values . private int findMin(int [] values) { int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE; for (int currentValue: values) { if (currentValue &lt; min) { min = currentValue; } } return min; } . Let’s Practice! . Popcorn hack #1 . // What needs to be changed to find the index of the max value? (write correct code in cell below) private int findMax(double [] values) { double max = values[0]; for (int index = 1; index &lt; values.length; index++) { max = values[index]; } return max; } . How to calculate the average value from objects in an array . It is a common task to determine what is the average value returned from items stored inside an array. In order to do this, we need a method that can take a parameter of an array of Objects (DebugDuck) and calculate and return the average value that each instance of DebugDuck returns from the method. . Inside the method; a local double variable is needed to store the accumulated values. Then we use a for loop to traverse the array and add the current total to the variable. After accumulating all the values we need to divide the total by the number of items stored in the array. . Using a standard for loop . private double calculateAverage(DebugDuck [] ducks) { double average = 0.0; for (int index = 0; index &lt; ducks.length; index++) { average += ducks[index].getQuestionCount(); } average = average / ducks.length; return average; } . Using a standard enhanced loop . private double calculateAverage(DebugDuck [] ducks) { double average = 0.0; for (DebugDuck currentDuck: ducks) { average += currentDuck.getQuestionCount(); } average = average / ducks.length; return average; } . Does the order of accumulation matter? . Can you declare the variable inside the loop? . Shfiting Array contents to the right . The contents of an array often need to be shifted as part of a solution to using the data inside. . We need to know how much to shift the array by. This will need to be an int obviously. . In order to move the contents we next need to make an empty array of the same size and then iterate over the original array and properly copy the values to the adjusted index in the new array. . We then need to assign the new array back into the original variable. . What kind of for loop should we use? Why? . int [] numbers = {1,2,3,4,5}; int [] shifted = new int [numbers.length]; int shift = 8; for (int index = 0; index &lt; numbers.length; index++) { shifted [Math.abs((index + shift) % numbers.length)] = numbers[index]; } numbers = shifted; for (int num : numbers) { System.out.println(num + &quot; &quot;); } . 3 4 5 1 2 . Why are we using the % operator? . Popcorn hack #2 . How would we code a left shift? Write a left shift using the variables below .

An array is a data structure used to implement a collection (list) of primitive or object reference data. . | An element is a single value in the array . | The **index** of an element is the position of the element in the array . In java, the first element of an array is at index 0. | . | The length of an array is the number of elements in the array. . length is a public final data member of an array . Since length is public, we can access it in any class! . | Since length is final we cannot change an array’s length after it has been created . | . | In Java, the last element of an array named list is at index list.length -1 . | . | . A look into list Memory . int [] listOne = new int[5]; . This will allocate a space in memory for 5 integers. . ARRAY: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] INDEX: 0 1 2 3 4 . Using the keyword new uses the default values for the data type. The default values are as follows: . Data Type Default Value . byte | (byte) 0 | . short | (short) 0 | . int | 0 | . double | 0.0 | . boolean | false | . char | ‘ u0000’ | . What do we do if we want to insert a value into the array? . listOne[0] = 5; . Gives us the following array: . ARRAY: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] INDEX: 0 1 2 3 4 . What if we want to initialize our own values? We can use an initializer list! . int [] listTwo = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; . Gives us the following array: . ARRAY: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] INDEX: 0 1 2 3 4 . If we try to access an index outside of the range of existing indexes, we will get an error. But why? Remember the basis of all programming languages is memory. Because we are trying to access a location in memory that does not exist, java will throw an error (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException). . How do we print the array? Directly printing the array will not work, it just prints the value of the array in memory. We need to iterate through the array and print each value individually! . /* lets take a look at the above */ int [] listOne = new int[5]; // Our list looks like [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] listOne[2] = 33; // Our list looks like [0, 0, 33, 0, 0] listOne[3] = listOne[2] * 3; // Our list looks like [0, 0, 33, 99, 0] try { listOne[5] = 13; // This will return an error } catch (Exception e) { System.out.println(&quot;Error at listOne[5] = 13&quot;); System.out.println(&quot;ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: We can&#39;t access a memory index that doesn&#39;t exist!&quot;); } System.out.println(listOne); // THIS DOES NOT PRINT THE LIST!!

Write code to print out every element of listOne the following . /* popcorn hacks go here */ . Reference elements . Lists can be made up of elements other than the default data types! We can make lists of objects, or even lists of lists! Lets say I have a class Student and I want to make a list of all students in the class. I can do this by creating a list of Student objects. . Student [] classList; classList new Student [3]; . Keep in mind, however, that the list won’t be generated with any students in it. They are initialized to null by default, and We need to create the students and then add them to the list ourselves. . classList[0] = new Student(&quot;Bob&quot;, 12, 3.5); classList[1] = new Student(&quot;John&quot;, 11, 4.0); classList[2] = new Student(&quot;Steve&quot;, 10, 3.75); . Popcorn hacks! . Use a class that you have already created and create a list of objects of that class. Then, iterate through the list and print out each object using: 1) a for loop 2) a while loop . /* Popcorn hacks go here */ . Enhanced for loops . The enhanced for loop is also called a for-each loop. Unlike a “traditional” indexed for loop with three parts separated by semicolons, there are only two parts to the enhanced for loop header and they are separated by a colon. . The first half of an enhanced for loop signature is the type of name for the variable that is a copy of the value stored in the structure. Next a colon separates the variable section from the data structure being traversed with the loop. . Inside the body of the loop you are able to access the value stored in the variable. A key point to remember is that you are unable to assign into the variable defined in the header (the signature) . You also do not have access to the indices of the array or subscript notation when using the enhanced for loop. . These loops have a structure similar to the one shown below: . for (type declaration : structure ) { // statement one; // statement two; // ... } . Popcorn Hacks! . Create an array, then use a enhanced for loop to print out each element of the array. . /* Popcorn hacks go here */ . Min maxing . It is a common task to determine what the largest or smallest value stored is inside an array. in order to do this, we need a method that can ake a parameter of an array of primitive values (int or double) and return the item that is at the appropriate extreme. .

Unlike an array, which can contain objects of a single type, a list can contain a mixture of objects. They start from 0. (The 1st element would actually be the 0th element) . List Functions . Creating a list: . In order to create a list named “aList”, type aList = []. This creates an empty list. A list with elements would look like this aList = [element1,element2,element3] . Append: . In Python, the append() method is used to add an element to the end of a list. The element in the parenthesis is what is added to the list. . # College Board Pseudo Code aList ← [] USER_INPUT ← (&quot;Enter an item you want (or &#39;q&#39; to quit): &quot;) REPEAT UNTIL USER_INPUT ← q{ APPEND (aList, USER_INPUT) } DISPLAY(aList) . aList = [] while True: user_input = input(&quot;Enter an item you want (or &#39;q&#39; to quit): &quot;) if user_input.lower() == &#39;q&#39;: break aList.append(user_input) print(&quot;Things You Want:&quot;, aList) . Things You Want: [&#39;1&#39;, &#39;item&#39;, &#39;2&#39;] . Accessing an element: . In order to access a specific element from a list, you would put the element in []. For example, If I had to access the third element in the list aList, I would say “aList[2]”. . # College Board Pseudo Code aList ← [] USER_INPUT ← (&quot;Enter an item you want (or &#39;q&#39; to quit): &quot;) REPEAT UNTIL USER_INPUT ← q{ APPEND (aList, USER_INPUT) } DISPLAY(aList[2]) . aList = [] while True: user_input = input(&quot;Enter an item you want (or &#39;q&#39; to quit): &quot;) if user_input.lower() == &#39;q&#39;: break aList.append(user_input) print(&quot;The Second thing on your list is&quot;, aList[1]) print(aList) . The Second thing on your list is 3 [&#39;2&#39;, &#39;3&#39;, &#39;6&#39;, &#39;hunt&#39;] . Deleting an element: . In order to delete an element, choose the element the same way you would access it but put “del” before it. For example, If I had to delete the third element in a list called aList, I would say “del aList[2]”. . # College Board Pseudo Code aList ← [] USER_INPUT ← (&quot;Enter an item you want (or &#39;q&#39; to quit): &quot;) REPEAT UNTIL USER_INPUT ← q{ APPEND (aList, USER_INPUT) } REMOVE (aList, 2) DISPLAY(aList) . aList = [] while True: user_input = input(&quot;Enter an item you want (or &#39;q&#39; to quit): &quot;) if user_input.lower() == &#39;q&#39;: break aList.append(user_input) print(&quot;This is your list: &quot;, aList) del aList[1] print(&quot;This is your new list: &quot;, aList) .

Remove the first element from the list and print the list. . # Code goes here: . Assigning a value: . To assign the values a list named bList to aList of one list to another you simply have to do aList = bList. . Length of a list: . To get the length of a list named aList, you just need to do len(aList). This gives you the number of elements in a list. . aList = [&quot;Yeezys&quot;,&quot;Yeezys&quot;] bList = [&quot;No Yeezys&quot;] bList = aList list_length = len(bList) print(&quot;Things I want:&quot;, bList) print(&quot;How many yeezys:&quot;,list_length) .

Original List: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] Modified List: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] Length of the list: 5 . Popcorn Hack #2 . Create a new list that modifies the original list by multiplying each element by 2 and prints the length of the list. . my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] print(&quot;Original List:&quot;, my_list) # Code goes here: . Original List: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] . Search: . A search algorithm is an algorithm that retrieves information stored in a data structure or calculated in the search space of a problem domain, with either discrete or continuous values. . Linear Search . The most basic way of searching in which each element is searched in the order it appears in the list. The list doesn’t need to be organized. . For the code given below, the algorithm compares each value to the previous value, and if the value is smaller than the previous value, that value becomes the new min. The algorithm continues until it reaches the end of the list. . nums[] ← [86, 75, 98, 100, 71, 65, 84] min ← nums[0] FOR EACH score IN nums[] DO IF score &lt; min THEN min ← score END IF END FOR OUTPUT &quot;The minimum value in the list is:&quot;, min . nums = [86, 75, 98, 100, 71, 65, 84] print(nums) min = nums[0] for score in nums: if (score &lt; min): min = score print(&quot;The minimum value in the list is:&quot;, min) . [86, 75, 98, 100, 71, 65, 84] The minimum value in the list is: 65 . Popcorn Hack #3 . Create a linear search algorithm that determines the maximum value in a list. . nums = [86, 75, 98, 100, 71, 65, 84] print(nums) # Code goes here: . Binary Search . A binary search, also known as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. . How does Binary Search work: . - Binary search works on sorted arrays. - Binary search begins by comparing an element in the middle of the array with the target value. - If the target value matches the element: - Its position in the array is returned and exit the program. - If the target value is less than the element: - The search continues in the lower half of the array. Go to Step-2 - If the target value is greater than the element, the search continues in the upper half of the array. Go to Step-2 - Go back to Step-2 . # Returns index of x in arr if present, else -1 def binary_search(arr, low, high, x): # Check base case if high &gt;= low: mid = (high + low) // 2 # If element is present at the middle itself if arr[mid] == x: return mid # If element is smaller than mid, then it can only # be present in left subarray elif arr[mid] &gt; x: return binary_search(arr, low, mid - 1, x) # Else the element can only be present in right subarray else: return binary_search(arr, mid + 1, high, x) else: # Element is not present in the array return -1 # Test array arr = [ 2, 3, 4, 10, 40 ] x = 10 # Function call result = binary_search(arr, 0, len(arr)-1, x) if result != -1: print(&quot;The Element is in index&quot;, str(result)) else: print(&quot;Element is not present in array&quot;) . The Element is in index 3 . # . Big O Notation . Usually used to denote how much run time an algorithm takes or how much memory is used by an algorithm. . In our case we are using it to show how many tries it will take for a search algorithm to find something. . Linear Search vs Binary Search big O notation: . - Linear search complexity is denoted by O(n) as every element in the array is compared only once. - In linear search, best-case complexity is O(1) where the element is found at the first index. - Worst-case complexity is O(n) where the element is found at the last index or the element is not present in the array. - Binary search, best-case complexity is O(1) where the element is found at the middle index. The worst-case complexity is O(log base 2 n). . Homework Hack . Create a binary search algorithm that sorts for the value 25. . nums = [12, 23, 25, 45, 47, 89, 91] # Code goes here: .",

            "content": "Made by: Ryan, Daniel, Saaras, Will, and Andrew . Python lists Operations . Append function . From the Data Abstractions Unit we Learned about lists and how they can store multiple variables . Today we’re going to show you how to add items to lists utilizing the append option . lst = [&quot;hi&quot;] lst.append(&quot;no&quot;) print(lst) . [&#39;hi&#39;, &#39;no&#39;] . Insert function . The insert function allows you to append items to different lists at a specific location. | Let’s first understand how it may work through pseudocode | . Exmaple 1 . INSERT alist, pos, value INSERT alist, 1, “hi” . Here the alist represents your list you want to append an item to | The position is where on the list the item will be generated in respect to the current list | Finally, the value is the item you’re adding to your list. | So in the code provided below, in position 1 you insert the item “hi” into alist | . Your turn!!!! . Turn this pseudocode into python | How may we want to implement this on python? Think back to the data abstraction unit. | ( Hint: Think about the differences between psueodcode and python ) | . # ANSWER: # Inserting items to a specific list, remember python is 0 based on the items!! lst.insert(5, &quot; maybe&quot;) print(lst) . [&#39; yes&#39;, &#39; yes&#39;, &#39; yes&#39;, &#39;hi&#39;, &#39;no&#39;, &#39; maybe&#39;, &#39; yes&#39;] . Remove function . The remove functions allows you to remove specific items at a specific position on the list | . Pseudocode example . REMOVE aList, pos | . lst.remove(lst[0]) print(lst) ## You can also access the list by the position, this is called list indexing print(lst[0]) . [&#39;hi&#39;, &#39;no&#39;, &#39; maybe&#39;, &#39; yes&#39;] hi . Let’s do some Collegeboard exercises . In the following list: nums = [65, 89, 92, 35, 84, 78, 28, 75] | . | Figure out what the minimum number in the list, WITHOUT using the other methods and premade functions. | . Second question: .

[&#39;cats&#39;] only one person works at this petshop and she likes cats. . ITS BINARY SEARCH TIME . By the end of this you should be able to know what binary search is | What the time complexity of binary search is | How to derive the time complexity for binary search | . HOW DOES BINARY SEARCH WORK . pay attention to the demonstration in the front | volunteers will be called up | candy if you participate | . Binary search is like a guessing game where you halve your options at each step. Imagine you’re finding a name in a phone book: . First Step: You open the book in the middle. | Second Step: Is the name before or after the middle? You eliminate half of the remaining names. | Repeat: Keep dividing until you find the name or run out of names to check. | MAKE SURE YOUR LIST IS SORTED Binary search will not work if the list isn’t sorted | Because you’re halving the options each time, it’s super quick. If you have (n) names, it takes at most ( log_2(n) ) steps to find a name. This efficiency, where the time it takes doesn’t increase much as the number of names in the phone book grows, is what makes binary search awesome! Binary search is also more optimal for searcihng compared to a linear search for anything that doesnt include small lists.. . Demo Being shown above . The sorted list we have currently, has integers [1, 3, 4, 5, 13, 20], we are currently trying to find the index of the the integer 1 within the list . How it works is we start at element 0 for our left position and element 5 for our rightwards position . Our middle position becaomes 5 because ((5+0)//2)=3 so element 3 . Our element 3 within the list gives us the integer 5 . We then realize that oh 5 is greater then 3 so we have to move leftwards . Then to make the algorithm more efficient we move the r backwards 1 beacuse we have already checked at this point . So now we can reduce the list to [1, 3, 4] . Now we can repeat the same steps as before and find the middle of this list which is 3 . We realize thats not equivalent to the integer 1, and our value is still too great . So we move the middle leftwards 1 positioon . AND BAM THATS HOW YOU CAN DO BINARY SEARCH . #example of binary search in python has a time complexity of O(n) def binarySearch(arr, x): l= 0 #our minimum element r=len(arr) - 1 # our maximum element while l &lt;= r: mid = l + (r - l) // 2 if arr[mid] == x: return mid elif arr[mid] &lt; x: l = mid + 1 else: r = mid - 1 return -1 sorted_list = [2, 5, 8, 12, 16] target = 3 result = binarySearch(sorted_list, 5) print(result) . 1 . #Linear Search Approach in O(n) def linear_search(target, sorted_list): for o in range(len(sorted_list)): if sorted_list[o]==target: return(o) #Does not have to be a sorted list for the sake of comparison I just made it sorted sorted_list = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15] target = 3 result = linear_search(target, sorted_list) print(result) . 1 . Using linear search make a list with elements [“eggs”, “milk”, “butter”, “cake”] Then randomize an element 1-4 within that list and find the index of it via linear search . #code here . How big O Notation works in the context works in the case of search methods. . Lets first explain for linear search, because linear search only requires a iterative approach all we use is O(n), this is due to the loop infinitely going until it finds the element and then after that it doesnt do anything. . However binary search is special in this sense because you don’t actually have to go through an entire loop how you can picture this is by imagining a list with 1000000 integer values in it and my target value is 59223, binary search makes it so that you just divide the list by 2 until you find the element. It’s a lot faster then the iterative approach, where I keep going until I get to 59223 what this does is it allows me to speed up the time and memory usage I take. because I keep dividing the list by 2 allowing for me to form a logarithm because its just repetitive multiplication of 1/2 and then that makes it so that O(log(n)) becomes the time complexity for the Binary search algorithm. . HW TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We want you guys to make a guessing game below, where utilizing binary search you can within a list of 100 sorted elemments find, a value that your code will randomize using random.randint(). We want you to also make it so every iteration output the number is higher up or lower until you actually get to the answer. We also want number of tries it took to guess the number. Points will be awarded for customizations and potential changes. . Extra credit (for above 95%): Send a screenshot on me to slack showing you can do this: https://codeforces.com/contest/1201/problem/C . #Code in here . HW Part 2: This time instead of utilizing binary search to do it I want you to use linear search to get to the same value and I want you to output the number of iterations it took to get there. Aswell as a congrats message upon getting there points will be awarded upon creativity and completion. . #Code in here .",

REMEMBER: comments are ignored by the compiler and anything written in them won’t execute . they’re used for people to make code more readable.. allows them to understand what’s happening without having to go further into the code | improves communication between TEAMS | allows code to be maintained over years | prevents execution when testing alternative code | . You are NOT required to write comments of AP Exam FRQs, but it is always a good habit . The types of comments: . 1) Single line: // 2) Multiline: /* */ 3) Java Doc: /** * * */ . /* Programmer: Date: Purpose */ public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { // variables double length = 2.5; double width = 4; //.. and so on } } /** * javadoc comments: * jkafhjdajhf * * @author * @version */ .

OUR GOAL: to define behaviors of an object through non-void methods NOT using parameters written in a class . REMEMBER: an accessor method allows other objects to access static variables . What is the purpose of an accessor method? . It allows us to safely access variables without other people being able to. Also called get methods or getters. . They’re necessary whenever another class needs to access a variable outside of that class. . // Example class public class Movie { // private instance variables private String name; private int runtime; // default constructor public Movie() { name = &quot;&quot;; runtime = 0; } // overloaded constructor: public Movie(String n, int c) { name = n; runtime = c; } // added ACCESSOR METHOD for each variable public String getName() { // header return name; // returning a COPY of the private instance variables } public int getRuntime() { return runtime } } . An accessor method must be: . public in order to be accessible | the return type must match the instance variable type | usually name of method is getNameOfVariable | should be NO PARAMETERS | . POPCORN HACKS: write an accessor method for each of the instance variables: . public class Course { private String name; private String gradeLevel; private int period; } . Let’s look at another example: . public class Sport { private String name; private int numAthletes; public Sport(String n, int num) { name = n; numAthletes = sum; } public String getName() { return name; } public int getNumAthletes () { return numAthletes; } } . Can we print out information about an instance of this object? . public class Sport { private String name; private int numAthletes; public Sport(String n, int num) { name = n; numAthletes = num; } public String getName() { return name; } public int getNumAthletes() { return numAthletes; } public static void main(String[] args) { Sport volleyball = new Sport(&quot;volleyball&quot;, 12); System.out.println(volleyball); } } Sport.main(null); . What output did we get? . The code outputs the Object class in the form of classname@HashCode in hexadecimal Let’s try using the toString method: . returns a string when System.out.println(object) is called | no parameters | . public class Sport { private String name; private int numAthletes; public Sport(String n, int num) { name = n; numAthletes = num; } public String getName() { return name; } public int getNumAthletes() { return numAthletes; } public String toString() { // toString method.. HEADER MUST BE WRITTEN IN THIS WAY return &quot;Sport: &quot; + name +&quot; nNumber of Athletes: &quot; + numAthletes; } public static void main(String[] args) { Sport volleyball = new Sport(&quot;volleyball&quot;, 12); System.out.println(volleyball); } } Sport.main(null); . 5.5. Mutators / Setters . Purpose: Mutators are used to change the values of the fields (attributes) of an object. . Access Control: Mutators are typically defined as public methods to allow external code to modify the object’s state. . Naming Convention: The method names for mutators usually start with “set” followed by the name of the field they modify. . Parameterized: Mutators take one or more parameters that represent the new values for the fields. . Return Type: Mutators are usually of type void, as they don’t return a value, but they modify the object’s state. . Encapsulation: Mutators are an essential part of encapsulation, which helps to protect the object’s state by controlling access through methods. . Validation: Mutators often include validation logic to ensure that the new values being set are within acceptable bounds or meet specific criteria. . Example Usage: Mutator for setting the age of a Person object might look like: public void setAge(int newAge) {…}. . Chaining: Mutators can be chained together in a single line for more fluent and concise code, e.g., person.setName(“John”).setAge(30);. . Immutable Objects: In some cases, mutators are not used, and instead, a new object with modified values is created. This approach is common in creating immutable objects in Java. . Example . public class UserAccount { private String username; private String password; private boolean isLoggedIn; public UserAccount(String username, String password) { this.username = username; this.password = password; this.isLoggedIn = false; } // Mutator for setting the username public void setUsername(String newUsername) { this.username = newUsername; } // Mutator for setting the password public void setPassword(String newPassword) { this.password = newPassword; } // Mutator for logging in public void login(String enteredUsername, String enteredPassword) { if (enteredUsername.equals(username) &amp;&amp; enteredPassword.equals(password)) { isLoggedIn = true; System.out.println(&quot;Login successful. Welcome, &quot; + username + &quot;!&quot;); } else { System.out.println(&quot;Login failed. Please check your username and password.&quot;); } } // Mutator for logging out public void logout() { isLoggedIn = false; System.out.println(&quot;Logged out successfully.&quot;); } // Accessor for checking if the user is logged in public boolean isLoggedIn() { return isLoggedIn; } public static void main(String[] args) { // Create a UserAccount UserAccount userAccount = new UserAccount(&quot;alice&quot;, &quot;password123&quot;); // Attempt to log in userAccount.login(&quot;alice&quot;, &quot;password123&quot;); // Check if the user is logged in if (userAccount.isLoggedIn()) { // Access the Scrum board or other features here System.out.println(&quot;Accessing Scrum boards...&quot;); } else { System.out.println(&quot;Access denied. Please log in.&quot;); } // Log out userAccount.logout(); } } . Hacks . Create a Java class BankAccount to represent a simple bank account. This class should have the following attributes: . accountHolder (String): The name of the account holder. balance (double): The current balance in the account. Implement the following mutator (setter) methods for the BankAccount class: . | setAccountHolder(String name): Sets the name of the account holder. | deposit(double amount): Deposits a given amount into the account. | withdraw(double amount): Withdraws a given amount from the account, but only if the withdrawal amount is less than or equal to the current balance. | . Ensure that the balance is never negative. . public class BankAccount { private String accountHolder; private double balance; // Constructor public BankAccount(String accountHolder, double balance) { // Initialize the account holder and balance attributes this.accountHolder = accountHolder; this.balance = balance; } // Implement the setAccountHolder method public void setAccountHolder(String name) { // Add code to set the account holder&#39;s name } // Implement the deposit method public void deposit(double amount) { // Add code to deposit the specified amount into the account } // Implement the withdraw method public void withdraw(double amount) { // Add code to withdraw the specified amount from the account // Ensure that the balance is never negative } public static void main(String[] args) { // Test the BankAccount class with sample operations // Create an instance of BankAccount BankAccount account = new BankAccount(&quot;John Doe&quot;, 1000.0); // Test the mutator methods account.setAccountHolder(&quot;Jane Doe&quot;); account.deposit(500.0); account.withdraw(200.0); // Print the updated account details System.out.println(&quot;Account holder: &quot; + account.accountHolder); System.out.println(&quot;Current balance: &quot; + account.balance); } } . 5.6 Writing Methods . Method Declaration: Define methods using the method keyword, specifying return type, method name, and parameters. | Method Parameters: Methods can take input parameters. | Return Statement: Use the return statement to return a value from a method. | Method Overloading: You can have multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists. | Static Methods: Static methods are associated with the class rather than instances. | Instance Methods: Instance methods are associated with an object of the class. | Access Modifiers: Use access modifiers like public, private, or protected to control visibility. | Method Invocation: Call methods using the dot notation on objects or classes (for static methods). | Recursive Methods: Methods can call themselves, creating recursive functions. | Varargs (Variable-Length Argument Lists): Use varargs to pass a variable number of arguments to a method. | . Example . public class Calculator { public int add(int operand1, int operand2) { return operand1 + operand2; } public int subtract(int operand1, int operand2) { return operand1 - operand2; } public int multiply(int operand1, int operand2) { return operand1 * operand2; } public int divide(int dividend, int divisor) { if (divisor != 0) { return dividend / divisor; } else { throw new ArithmeticException(&quot;Division by zero is not allowed.&quot;); } } public static void main(String[] args) { Calculator calculator = new Calculator(); int resultAdd = calculator.add(5, 3); int resultSubtract = calculator.subtract(10, 7); int resultMultiply = calculator.multiply(4, 6); int resultDivide = calculator.divide(8, 2); System.out.println(&quot;Addition: &quot; + resultAdd); System.out.println(&quot;Subtraction: &quot; + resultSubtract); System.out.println(&quot;Multiplication: &quot; + resultMultiply); System.out.println(&quot;Division: &quot; + resultDivide); } } . Hacks . Create a Java class MathUtility with a set of utility methods for mathematical operations. Implement the following methods: . calculateAverage(double[] numbers): Calculate the average of an array of numbers. | isPrime(int number): Check if a given integer is prime. | findFactors(int number): Find and return an array of factors for a given integer. Include proper error handling for edge cases and invalid input. | . public class MathUtility { // Implement the calculateAverage method public double calculateAverage(double[] numbers) { // Add code to calculate and return the average of the numbers } // Implement the isPrime method public boolean isPrime(int number) { // Add code to check if the given number is prime } // Implement the findFactors method public int[] findFactors(int number) { // Add code to find and return the factors of the given number } public static void main(String[] args) { // Test the MathUtility class with sample mathematical operations MathUtility mathUtility = new MathUtility(); // Test the utility methods double[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}; double average = mathUtility.calculateAverage(numbers); System.out.println(&quot;Average of the numbers: &quot; + average); int numberToCheck = 17; boolean isPrime = mathUtility.isPrime(numberToCheck); System.out.println(numberToCheck + &quot; is prime: &quot; + isPrime); int numberToFactor = 12; int[] factors = mathUtility.findFactors(numberToFactor); System.out.print(&quot;Factors of &quot; + numberToFactor + &quot;: &quot;); for (int factor : factors) { System.out.print(factor + &quot; &quot;); } } } . 5.7 Static Variables and Methods . Static Methods . Define behaviors of a class (belong to class, NOT object) | Keyword static in header before method name | Can only: access/change static variables | Can’t: access/change instance variables or the class’ instance variables, no this reference | . Practice . Should we use a static or non-static method? . public class Assignment{ // next classwork/homework ID is NEXT number of classwork/homework that will be created private static int nextClassworkID = 1; private static int nextHomeworkID = 1; private String name; private int pointValue; // constructors and methods not shown } . Question: What is the static data and what is the instance data? . Answer: . Question: A method getGrade is given an int score earned on the assignment and returns the percentage (as a decimal) earned by that score. Would this be implemented as a static or non-static method? . Think: What data does it need access to? If needs access to instance data, needs to be non-static. If only need access to static data, it can be static. | . Answer: non-static, since the method would need to access pointValue which is an instance variable. . Popcorn Hacks: write getGrade method . public class Assignment{ // next classwork/homework ID is NEXT number of classwork/homework that will be created private static int nextClassworkID = 1; private static int nextHomeworkID = 1; private String name; private int pointValue; // method here } . Question: Would a method that reports the total number of assignments be static or non-static? . Answer: static, since the method would only need to access static data . Popcorn Hacks: write this method totalAssign . public class Assignment{ // next classwork/homework ID is NEXT number of classwork/homework that will be created private static int nextClassworkID = 1; private static int nextHomeworkID = 1; private String name; private int pointValue; // method here } . Multiple Choice Question . public class Example{ private static int goal = 125; private int current; public Example (int c) { // code segment 1 } public static void resetGoal (int g) { // code segment 2 } // other methods not shown } . Which of the following statements is true? . Code segment 1 can use the variable goal but cannot use the variable current. | Code segment 1 cannot use the variable goal but can use the variable current. | Code segment 2 can use the variable goal but cannot use the variable current. | Code segment 2 cannot use the variable goal but can use the variable current. | Both code segments have access to both variables | Question: Which ones can code segment 1 (constructor) use? . Static Variables . Define static variables that belong to the class, all object of the class sharing that single static variable (associated with class, NOT objects of class) | Either public or private | static keyword before variable type | used with class name and dot operator | . Multiple Choice Question . public class Example{ private static int goal = 125; private int current; public Example (int c) { // code segment 1 } public static void resetGoal (int g) { // code segment 2 } // other methods not shown } . Which of the following statements is true? . Objects e1 and e2 each have a variable goal and variable current. | Objects e1 and e2 share the variable goal and share the variable current. | Objects e1 and e2 share the variable goal and each have a variable current. | Objects e1 and e2 each have a variable goal and share the variable goal and share the variable current. | The code does not complie because static variables must be public. | 5.8 Scope and Access . Local variables: variables declared in body of constructors and methods, only use within constructor or method, can’t be declaed public or private | If local variable named same as instance variable, within that method the local variable will be referred to | . public class Bowler{ private int totalPins; private int games; public Bowler(int pins){ totalPins = pins; games = 3; } public void update (int game1, int game2, int game3) { // local variable here is newPins int newPins = game1 + game2 + game3; totalPins += newPins; games += 3; } } . Multiple Choice Question . public class Example{ private int current; public Example(int c){ double factor = Math.random(); current = (int)(c * factor); } public void rest (int num) { private double factor = Math.random(); current += (int)(num * factor) } // other methods not shown } . Which of the following is the reason this code does not compile? . The reset method cannot declare a variable named factor since a vriable named factor is declared in the constructor. | The reset method cannot declare factor as private since factor is a local variable not an instance variable. | The constructor cannot declare a variable named factor since a variable named factor is declared in the reset method. | The constructor cannot access the isntance variable current since current is private. | There is no syntax error in this code and it would compile. | 5.9 this Keyword . this keyword . a keyword that essentially refers to the object that is calling the method or the object that the constructor is trying to make&lt;/detail&gt; ### Can be used 3 Ways: 1. **refer to instance variable** &gt; This will solve the problem of having duplicate variable names. To distinguish the instance and local variables, we use this.variableName for the instance variable and simply variableName for the local variable. 2. **parameter** &gt; Sometimes, we can also use the object as a parameter in its own method call to use itself in the method by using objectName.methodName(this). 3. **constructor or method call** &gt; Sometimes, we can also use the object as a parameter in its own method call to use itself in the method by using objectName.methodName(this). Using **this()** in a constructor &gt;&gt; Calls the no-arg constructor or the constructor without any parameters of the current class, can also call other constructor that hav parameters by passing correct numb and type of args between parenthesis ^^ using **this()** can help you reuse code from one constructor in another **this** in Java &gt;&gt; is limited to current object = only be used to access instance variables and invoke non-static methods python public class Dog { private String breed; public String getBreed(){ return breed; } public boolean isSameBreed(Dog otherDog){ return // breed.equals(otherDog.breed); // this.breed.equals(otherDog.breed); // **this** makes the code more readable/clear but is not required } } python public class DogCompetition { public boolean doBreedMatch (Dog dog1, Dog dog2){ return this.getBreed().equals(dog2.getBreed()); // **this** refers to object which was used to call doBreedsMatch and is a DogCompetition object, not dog object (CANNOT CALL getBreed()) // this.dog1 // dog1 is not data member (parameter) so incorrect // doBreedMatch doesn&#39;t use any data from DogCompetition class no way to use this } } ### Local vs Instance Make the code a little clearer by using the **this** keyword b,a,w,and s aren&#39;t meaningful parameters change them into breed, age, weight, and score distinguish the local and instance variables using the **this** keyword python public class Dog { private String breed; private int age; private double weight; private double score; public Dog(sting b, int a, double w, double s){ // 1. make this code a little clearer by using the **this** keyword // 2. change the parameters into something more meaningful // 3. distinguish local vs instance variables using **this** keyword breed = b; age = a; weight = w; score - s; } } ### HACKS 1. what does using **this()** in a constructor mean in your own words ## 5.10 Ethical and Social Implications of Computing Systems ### Impacts Programming affects the world in many ways, such as socially, economically, and culturally. For instance, not everyone has the same access to technology and computer programs, which creates social inequalities. Some people can use technology, while others can&#39;t. **Digital Divide** The global economy relies heavily on technology and computer programs, especially in areas like stock trading and economic predictions. Programming and technology have also made the world more connected, allowing different cultures to mix and making it easier for people to communicate globally. However, this has also created a gap between generations, with younger people having more exposure to digital technology than older generations. **These impacts on society, the economy, and culture can be both good and bad.** ### System Reliability When programmers create software, they need to consider how reliable the system is. Different devices can perform the same task at varying speeds and in different ways. Each system may have security issues that hackers can exploit. To make systems more reliable, programmers need to fix any bugs as soon as they find them. These fixes are then released to users as updates or patches to ensure that computers can be used safely and correctly. ### Intellectual Property Usually, when people create programs on the internet, they own them. However, open source programs blur this line. In open source programs, anyone can make improvements to the code if the program owner allows it. Licensing and access also play a role in letting others adapt and build on existing code to create their own programs. There are different types of licenses, like Creative Commons and MIT License, each serving different purposes. Here is an [article](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository) on how to add a license on your Repository ### HACKS As a team decide what license you want and add it to your repository (add a screenshot of it in your team ticket)",

They are just two different ways of doing them! . Whats the difference between these two math problems: . 3((9-6)+7) + 7 - (9+8) . 3(9-(6+7)) + 7 - 9 + 8 . A lot! This changes the output by quite a bit! . Here are examples of this basic concept in terms of programming: . print(&quot;What is the temperature outside °F?&quot;) temp = int(input()) if temp &gt; 85: print(&quot;It is too hot outside!&quot;) elif temp &gt;= 65: print(&quot;Sure, I will play outside!&quot;) else: print(&quot;It is too cold outside!&quot;) . print(&quot;What is the temperature outside °F?&quot;) temp = int(input()) if temp == 85: print(&quot;It is too hot outside!&quot;) if temp == 65: print(&quot;Sure, I will play outside!&quot;) if temp &lt; 65: print(&quot;It is too cold outside!&quot;) . Didn’t get it? . Hint: . What if I input 60 degrees °F? | What if I input 90 degrees °F? | . Hack #1: What is the difference between these two pieces of code?

So when developing algorithms, different pieces of code could do the same thing, and two similar pieces of code could do very different things. . Data Collections . Purpose of Data Collection . To gather accurate and relevant information for specific purposes, such as solving problems, making informed decisions, or predicting future trends. . Techniques . Surveys and Questionnaires: Structured methods for gathering data from a large number of respondents. They can be administered in-person, online, or through other mediums. . Observations: Watching and recording actions or behaviors in a systematic manner. . Experiments: Conducting controlled tests or trials to determine cause and effect relationships. . Simulations: Using models to imitate real-world situations. . Interviews: One-on-one or group discussions to gain in-depth insights. . Sensors and Automated Collection: Using electronic devices to automatically collect data, like temperature sensors or traffic cameras. . Sampling: Instead of studying an entire population, a subset (or sample) can be studied to make inferences about the entire group. . Techniques include random sampling, stratified sampling, and convenience sampling. . Bias and Error . Data collection methods can introduce bias or error. It’s crucial to be aware of potential sources of bias, like leading questions in surveys or non-random sampling methods. . Privacy and Ethics . Always consider the ethical implications of data collection. Obtain consent when necessary, anonymize data to protect individuals’ privacy, and be transparent about how data will be used. . Hack #2: . def find_max(numbers): max_value = numbers[0] for number in numbers: if number &gt; max_value: max_value = number return max_value #List of numbers numbers = [23, 45, 67, 89, 12, 34, 56, 78] max_value = find_max(numbers) print(max_value) .

Creating/Modifying Algorithms . Important steps for creating an algorithm: . Define functions | Initialize ways to store data (array, lists, dictionaries, etc…) | Depending on the context, use iteration to specify conditions for variable | Output generated values from the algorithm | . Helpful tips for modifying algorithms: . Understand the algorithm so you’re able to easily apply changes to it. | Break the program down into chunks. | Focus on each small part of the algorithm to get it to work. | Make sure to test individual components, and then the whole code together (This makes identifying errors, and correcting mistakes easier). | . Example (The sum of all even numbers between 1 and a given positive integer): . def sum_of_evens(n): total = 0 for i in range(2, n + 1, 2): #Note the 2 and the very end initializes a step size of 2 for the function total += i return total n = int(input(&quot;Enter a positive integer: &quot;)) result = sum_of_evens(n) print(f&quot;The sum of even numbers from 1 to {n} is {result}&quot;) . Hack #3: . TODO: Adapt the above algorithm to output for the sum of odd numbers between 1 and a given integer. . Try to come up with a unique algorithm (way) to achieve the above task. . # Place your code here... . Solution: . Think about how you would define an odd number, and output the sum of each element. . def sum_of_odd_numbers(n): total = 0 for i in range(1, n + 1): if i % 2 != 0: # Check if the number is odd total += i return total n = int(input(&quot;Enter a value for n: &quot;)) result = sum_of_odd_numbers(n) print(f&quot;The sum of odd numbers from 1 to {n} is: {result}&quot;) . Random Number Generation . RANDOM (a, b) generates a number from a to b inclusive. Each result from the randomization is equally likely to occur. Using random number generation in a program means each execution may produce a different result. We can use the results from randomization to program simulations. . What are the possibities for Answ3? Answ1 (0,2) #This means Answ1 can be anywhere from 0 to 2 Answ2 (1,5) #This means Answ1 can be anywhere from 1 to 5 Answ3 = Answ1 + Answ2 . ﻿The lowest number answ1 will generate is 0 and the lowest number answ2 will generate is 1. Therefore, the lowest number answ3 could be is 1. The highest number answ1 will generate is 2 and the highest number answ2 will generate is 5. Therefore, the highest number answ3 could be is 7. . Generating Random Values: . In AP CSP, students learn to generate random values using certain code constructs, like the random module in Python which allows for random integer generation between specified values using random.randint(a, b)​1​. This random number generation introduces an element of unpredictability, vital for many programming applications. Application in Simulations: | Random values are crucial in simulations, mimicking real-world unpredictability. They help in creating diverse scenarios in simulations like weather patterns or game dynamics, thus providing a more realistic or varied simulation experience. Evaluating Code Segments: | Utilizing random values can aid in evaluating code segments by testing how code reacts to varied input, which is particularly useful in identifying potential bugs or inefficiencies. | . If you roll a die 3 times, and take the sum of all your rolls, what is the highest possible amount and the lowest possible amount you can get? . Roll 1 (1,6) Roll 2 (1,6) Roll 3 (1,6) . Lowest: 3 Most: 18 . import random def generate_random(): value = random.randint(1, 100) print(f&#39;Random value between 1 and 100: {value}&#39;) dice_roll = random.randint(1, 6) print(f&#39;Dice Roll: {dice_roll}&#39;) # Call the function generate_random() . Hack #4 . Lets continue the fun… Make an algorithm that assigns 5 days with a random temperatures between 60-90 degrees Fahrenheit! . # Place your code here... temp = [] days=[&quot;M&quot;,&quot;T&quot;,&quot;W&quot;,&quot;T&quot;,&quot;F&quot;] for i in range(0, 5): temp = random.randint(60, 90) print(days[i], temp) . Solution: . How can you iterate between a range of 5 days, along with generate a random temperature between 60-90? . import random def simulate_weather(): for day in range(1, 6): temperature = random.randint(60, 90) print(f&#39;Day {day}: Temperature: {temperature}°F&#39;) # Call the function simulate_weather() . Homework: . Create a program that follows the Collatz Conjecture. | If a number is even, divide by 2. . If a number is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1. . If implemented correctly this algorithm will eventually go to 1. Try defining the initial number with any number beside 1 to see an interesting ouput. Output the result as a list. You may set a starting value for the list, so that the program can generate the list of numbers created when following the process. . Ideas for above 90%: Try implementing user input into this program. Ask the user to enter a number they would like to start with. . # Place your code here... . Create an algorithm that generates terms to the Fibonacci Sequence which outputs a specific number of terms defined in your code. The sequence starts off like 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, … each following term being the sum of the previous two. | Ideas for above 90%: . Add user input | Display error message when an invalid input is specified | Find a way for the program to only specify a specific term in the sequence | . # Place your code here... . Make a statistics calculator that calculates the mean, median, and mode of a specific series. Do this using iteration and without the use of imported modules (like the statistics one) that allows you to call pre defined functions like mean, median, and mode. Each of these calculations follows an algorithm. | Ideas for above 90%: .

            "title": "JPA",
            "content": "What is JPA? . JPA, which stands for Java Persistence API, is a specification for persisting data with Java objects. (Persistence means that the object is stored in a database). JPA has multiple implementations, the most popular being Hibernate. Hibernate is an ORM tool. ORM, or Object Relational Mapping, maps a Java object to a database. This allows us to do CRUD operations (create, read, update, and delete data) on the object. . Note that Spring Data JPA and JPA are two different things. Spring Data JPA abstracts JPA. It reduces the amount of boilerplate code that programmers have to write by providing repositories for CRUD operations. This means that SQL knowledge isn’t required to work with Spring Boot. However, knowing SQL can help you perform more powerful queries. . Below is a helpful visualization of the relationship between JPA, Spring Data JPA, Hibernate, and ORM (credit to Amigoscode): . . . Setup . Within the mvc folder in spring_portfolio, create a new folder and give it a name. The new folder will hold the POJO (entity class), API controller, and JPA repository. You can name the files anything, but the convention for JPA repository is to include JpaRepository or Repository within the name. In this example, the JPA repository file is named UserJpaRepository.java. . . This blog will use a user database as an example. For reference, this is what the User POJO (User.java) looks like. Attributes of the user include the user’s email, password, and name. Note that there are lots of annotations (the lines that start with a @) that can add more features to the attributes. . @Data @AllArgsConstructor @NoArgsConstructor @Entity public class User { @Id @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO) private Long id; private String email; private String password; private String firstName; private String lastName; } . This is what the user table looks like: . . . There are many ways to perform CRUD operations in Spring. This blog will cover derived queries, JPQL, and native queries. . Derived Queries . Derived queries are simple methods such as findBy, readBy, getBy, etc. Spring Data translates the derived queries into the JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) query (which is then translated into SQL), making things easier for you. . To create derived queries, open the JPA repository file. The file looks similar to this: . public interface UserJpaRepository extends JpaRepository&lt;User, Long&gt; { } . One thing to note is that the generic (ex: &lt;User, Long&gt;) takes in two type parameters. The first is the entity type (the name of the POJO class), in this case, User. The second is the type of the ID found in the POJO (since ID was declared as private Long id; in User.java, the second type parameter is Long). . You can create derived queries within the interface. Let’s say we want to obtain a list of users based on their last name. The findBy method can be used to achieve this: . public interface UserJpaRepository extends JpaRepository&lt;User, Long&gt; { List&lt;User&gt; findByLastName(String lastName); } . findBy&lt;Attribute&gt; finds the column in the table that is associated with the attribute. For example, when Spring sees findByLastName, it will look at the column that is associated with LastName. Note that SQL tables and Java have different naming conventions. When declaring a variable in Java, an uppercase letter is used to symbolize a space (ex: lastName for last name). In an SQL table’s column names, spaces are separated by a “_”. . For example, the user table’s column has first_name and last_name, not firstName and lastName. This difference is important to note, an example of this will be covered later. . . . Additionally, the return type of the method is List&lt;User&gt;. This is because there can be multiple User objects that have the last name we are looking for, so a list of users needs to be returned. . findByLastName tells Spring to look at the last_name column in the user database. Spring will then return the users that have the requested last name in a list. Something to note here is that the first letter of the attribute in the findBy method is capitalized. In this case, the “l” in findByLastName is capitalized. This tells Spring to look for the column name associated with the attribute lastName. The Spring Data JPA documentation provides an interesting read on how Spring determines the attribute from the query method. . Lastly, (String lastName) takes in a last name as an input. . findByLastName(String lastName) can be tested with an API Controller. . The API Controller class (UserApiController.java) looks like this: . @RestController @RequestMapping(&quot;/api/users&quot;) public class UserApiController { @Autowired private UserJpaRepository userRepo; @GetMapping(&quot;/search&quot;) public ResponseEntity&lt;List&lt;User&gt;&gt; search() { return new ResponseEntity&lt;&gt;(userRepo.findByLastName(&quot;Van Pelt&quot;), HttpStatus.OK); } } . The first thing we want to do in the API Controller class is to autowire the JPA repository: . @Autowired private UserJpaRepository userRepo; . Autowire does dependency injection, which means it injects beans into the class it’s in. This is a long and interesting topic that I may write another blog post about when I have time. In simplified terms, Autowire has Spring instantiate objects so that programmers don’t need to do it themselves. . Afterwards, create an endpoint that returns the User objects with a last name of “Van Pelt” in JSON. Here, the findByLastName method (which was defined in the JPA repository) is called, with an input of “Van Pelt” as the last name. When a GET request is sent to the endpoint, Spring will search the user table for users that have a last name of “Van Pelt”. . return new ResponseEntity&lt;&gt;(userRepo.findByLastName(&quot;Van Pelt&quot;), HttpStatus.OK); . Accessing the endpoint on Postman returns the two users who have a last name of “Van Pelt”: . . . Other query methods . List&lt;entity class&gt; findByAttributeContaining(String a);: Returns a list of objects whose attribute has a substring that matches the input’s string . | List&lt;entity class&gt; findByAttributeNotNull();: Returns a list of objects whose attribute is not null . | . . Example . JPA repository . public interface UserJpaRepository extends JpaRepository&lt;User, Long&gt; { List&lt;User&gt; findByLastName(String lastName); List&lt;User&gt; findByFirstNameContaining(String letters); List&lt;User&gt; findByLastNameNotNull(); } . API Controller . @RestController @RequestMapping(&quot;/api/users&quot;) public class UserApiController { @Autowired private UserJpaRepository userRepo; @GetMapping(&quot;/search&quot;) public ResponseEntity&lt;List&lt;User&gt;&gt; search() { return new ResponseEntity&lt;&gt;(userRepo.findByLastName(&quot;Van Pelt&quot;), HttpStatus.OK); } @GetMapping(&quot;/partial&quot;) public ResponseEntity&lt;List&lt;User&gt;&gt; partial() { return new ResponseEntity&lt;&gt;(userRepo.findByFirstNameContaining(&quot;oo&quot;), HttpStatus.OK); } @GetMapping(&quot;/haslastname&quot;) public ResponseEntity&lt;List&lt;User&gt;&gt; hasLastName() { return new ResponseEntity&lt;&gt;(userRepo.findByLastNameNotNull(), HttpStatus.OK); } } . In this example, findByFirstNameContaining outputs users whose first name contains the substring “oo”: . . In this example, findByLastNameNotNull outputs users who have a last name: . . . JPQL Query . Sometimes simply creating methods using derived queries is not enough. JPQL is more flexible in that it provides a query language that looks similar to SQL. One important thing to note is that JPQL is based on entities, so JPQL queries are based on classes and attributes. JPQL queries are not based on the database tables, which makes it different from SQL. The database, however, still uses SQL. JPA implementations like Hibernate translate the JPQL query into SQL to work with the database. . Here’s an example of a JPQL query that does the same thing as findByLastName(). . @Query(&quot;SELECT u FROM User u where u.lastName = ?1&quot;) List&lt;User&gt; findByLastNameQuery(String lastName); . First, use the @Query annotation, and then define the query in JPQL. In this example, the query selects the User entity and finds the user objects where the user’s last name matches the input. Additionally, the u in the query is an alias for the User class. You can think of it as a variable that refers to the User class. This alias makes it quicker when referring to User in the query. The alias can be anything. For instance, “SELECT a FROM User a where a.lastName = ?1” would also work. . Next, add the method declaration after the annotation. You can name the method name (ex: findByLastNameQuery) anything. . Positional parameters and named parameters . In the query SELECT u FROM User u where u.lastName = ?1&quot;, ?1 is a positional parameter. This means that ?1 will correspond to the 1st parameter in the method (ex: lastName). So when findByLastNameQuery(&quot;Van Pelt&quot;) is called, the query becomes SELECT u FROM User u where u.lastName = &#39;Van Pelt&#39;. . You can have multiple positional parameters in the query. Here is an example of searching for a user based on both first and last name: . JPA repository: . @Query(&quot;SELECT u FROM User u where u.lastName = ?1 and u.firstName = ?2&quot;) List&lt;User&gt; findByName(String lastName, String firstName); . API Controller: . @GetMapping(&quot;/search&quot;) public ResponseEntity&lt;List&lt;User&gt;&gt; search() { return new ResponseEntity&lt;&gt;(userRepo.findByName(&quot;Brown&quot;, &quot;Charlie&quot;), HttpStatus.OK); } . Endpoint: . . . You could also assign names instead of numbers to the parameters. Below is an example of using named parameters: . @Query(&quot;SELECT u FROM User u where u.lastName = :last and u.firstName = :first&quot;) List&lt;User&gt; findByName(@Param(&quot;last&quot;) String lastName, @Param(&quot;first&quot;) String firstName); . Replace ?1 and ?2 with :&lt;parameter name&gt;, and refer to them in the method with @Param(&quot;&lt;parameter name&gt;&quot;). . . Native Queries . While JPQL provides more flexibility than derived queries, it doesn’t have all of the features of SQL. Native queries allows the programmer to execute SQL queries. The syntax of a native query is similar to a JPQL query: . @Query( value = &quot;SELECT email FROM user&quot;, nativeQuery = true ) List&lt;String&gt; findEmail(); . In this example, the SQL query is &quot;SELECT email FROM user&quot;, which returns all of the emails from the email column in the database. One thing to note is that unlike JPQL, which is based on the entity class, native queries are based on the database. Therefore, native queries should use names from the database and table columns. . Accessing the endpoint returns a list of email strings: . . . Troubleshooting . While coding in Spring Boot, it is very likely that at some point you’ll encounter errors that’ll prevent you from being able to run your backend framework. While coding in Spring for this blog, I encountered many error messages. This is what I do to resolve these errors: . Make sure the terminal window is long enough to view the entire error message. Usually, the most important error message is at the beginning, so you’ll want to be able to scroll to the beginning of the message. One of the error messages I encountered while coding looked like this: . . The error message was so long that it couldn’t fit in my terminal, so I couldn’t see the top part of the error message. I pasted the error message that occurred towards the middle of the output (similar to the the message next to the blue text in the picture) and spent a lot of time trying to figure out what was going on. I couldn’t find anything to help me fix the problem, and that was because I was searching for the wrong error. . In order to see the beginning of the output, it helps to expand your terminal. The “Spring” banner is very helpful in marking where the error message starts. . . | Copy the error and paste it into Google. ChatGPT is also a helpful tool, but it’s best to verify it by Googling. I’ve asked ChatGPT to explain some Spring Boot concepts, but found that ChatGPT provided some wrong information after double checking with Google. . | Research. Look at StackOverflow posts where people have had similar errors. Usually, you’ll learn something new after discovering how to fix the bug. For instance, while researching the error I had, I learned that derived queries were an abstraction for JPQL queries, and I learned about Hibernate and ORM. Researching about JPQL also helped me understand more about SQL. Troubleshooting can be time consuming and requires patience, but the deeper understanding gained after figuring out the solution makes the amount of time spent into it worth it. . |",

            "content": "Overview . College Board Unit 1 has a focus on primitive types of int, double, and boolean. In Unit 1, String is mentioned, but it is NOT a primitive type. A String is essentially a sequence of characters and is called a reference data type, where each character is represented by the primitive char data type. . This mini-lab covers a comprehensive overview of Java primitive types, input/output, and the use of wrapper classes and reference data types. The examples and explanations provided will greatly assist students in understanding these concepts and applying them in their own code. . The mini-lab “Hacks” covers the essential aspects of primitive types in a concise manner. It provides students with opportunities for hands-on practice and encourages them to think creatively with the suggested activities. . Data Types . Unit 1 focuses on primitive data types. Now is a good time to compare primitives with other Java data types. Review and compare data types with a focus on those prefixed with an asterisk, as they are required knowledge by College Board and will be on the AP Exam. . Primitive Data Types: These are the basic data types in Java, representing fundamental values. . *boolean: Represents true or false values. | byte: Represents a signed 8-bit integer value. | short: Represents a signed 16-bit integer value. | *int: Represents a signed 32-bit integer value. | long: Represents a signed 64-bit integer value. | float: Represents a single-precision 32-bit floating-point value. | *double: Represents a double-precision 64-bit floating-point value. | char: Represents a single Unicode character. | . Reference Data Types: These are more complex data types that can hold a collection of values or represent custom-defined entities. . *String: Represents a sequence of characters. | *Arrays: Represents a collection of elements of the same data type. | *Classes: In Java, classes can be used to define custom data structures and entities that may contain primitives, strings, enums, wrapper classes, or arrays. Programmers define their own reference data types to create abstract data types or data structures. A Users class or a Graph class for Graph Theory are custome data types. | *Collection Framework: Java provides built-in classes like ArrayList, Queue, Stack, and HashMap as part of the Collections framework. A collection is an object that can hold references to other objects. The Generic type declaration (ie &lt;Integer&gt;) allows the prorgrammer to provide the type of Object that a collection will contain, | . Hybrid Data Types . *Wrapper Classes: Represents primitive data types as oan bjects (e.g., Boolean, Integer, Double). They are classes but still behave like behavior of primitive types with regards to pass-by-value . Therefore, they are not considered true reference data types. | Enums: Enums: Represents a fixed set of constants that are immutable. Enums are useful for representing a predefined set of values (ie public enum Suit {SPADES, CLUBS, HEARTS, DIAMONDS};). | . public class DefinePrimitives { public static void main(String[] args) { int anInt = 100; double aDouble = 89.9; boolean aBoolean = true; // not primitives but essential String aString = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;; // wrapper class shortcut assignment String aStringFormal = new String(&quot;Greetings, World!&quot;); System.out.println(&quot;anInt: &quot; + anInt); System.out.println(&quot;aDouble: &quot; + aDouble); System.out.println(&quot;aBoolean: &quot; + aBoolean); System.out.println(&quot;aString: &quot; + aString); System.out.println(&quot;aStringFormal: &quot; + aStringFormal); } } DefinePrimitives.main(null) . Input Primitive data . Input is a key concept to all programming. The assignments in previous example are “static” or “hard coded”. The examples when you use input are supplied by the user. . Scanner is the java utility class for console input. . // import the Scanner class from the java.util package. import java.util.Scanner; // class must alway have 1st letter as uppercase, CamelCase is Java Class convention public class ScanPrimitives { public static void main(String[] args) { Scanner input; // primitive int input = new Scanner(System.in); System.out.print(&quot;Enter an integer: &quot;); try { int sampleInputInt = input.nextInt(); System.out.println(sampleInputInt); } catch (Exception e) { // if not an integer System.out.println(&quot;Not an integer (form like 159), &quot; + e); } finally { input.close(); } // primitive double input = new Scanner(System.in); System.out.print(&quot;Enter a double: &quot;); try { double sampleInputDouble = input.nextDouble(); System.out.println(sampleInputDouble); } catch (Exception e) { // if not a number System.out.println(&quot;Not an double (form like 9.99), &quot; + e); } finally { input.close(); } // primitive boolean input = new Scanner(System.in); System.out.print(&quot;Enter a boolean: &quot;); try { boolean sampleInputBoolean = input.nextBoolean(); System.out.println(sampleInputBoolean); } catch (Exception e) { // if not true or false System.out.println(&quot;Not an boolean (true or false), &quot; + e); } finally { input.close(); } // wrapper class String input = new Scanner(System.in); System.out.print(&quot;Enter a String: &quot;); try { String sampleInputString = input.nextLine(); System.out.println(sampleInputString); } catch (Exception e) { // this may never happen System.out.println(&quot;Not an String, &quot; + e); } finally { input.close(); } } } ScanPrimitives.main(null); . Output Primitive Data . The second key to to all programming is Output. All programming has means to format and combine data. In these examples you see descriptions of the mathematical operation combine with the result of the operation. . public class PrimitiveDivision { public static void main(String[] args) { int i1 = 7, i2 = 2; System.out.println(&quot;Integer Division&quot;); System.out.println(&quot; tint output with concatenation: &quot; + i1 + &quot;/&quot; + i2 + &quot; = &quot; + i1/i2); System.out.println(String.format(&quot; tint output with format: %d/%d = %d&quot;,i1, i2, i1/i2)); System.out.printf(&quot; tint output with printf: %d/%d = %d n&quot;,i1, i2, i1/i2); double d1 = 7, d2 = 2; System.out.println(&quot;Double Division&quot;); System.out.println(&quot; tdouble output with concatenation: &quot; + d1 + &quot;/&quot; + d2 + &quot; = &quot; + d1/d2); System.out.println(String.format(&quot; tdouble output with format: %.2f/%.2f = %.2f&quot;,d1, d2, d1/d2)); System.out.printf(&quot; tdouble output with printf: %.2f/%.2f = %.2f n&quot;,d1, d2, d1/d2); System.out.println(&quot;Casting and Remainders&quot;); System.out.printf(&quot; tint cast to double on division: %d/%d = %.2f n&quot;,i1, i2, i1/(double)i2); System.out.println(&quot; tint using modulo for remainder: &quot; + i1 + &quot;/&quot; + i2 + &quot; = &quot; + i1/i2 + &quot; remainder &quot; + i1%i2); } } PrimitiveDivision.main(null); . Grade Calculator, putting Input and Output together . Primitive types rarely stand alone. This lab uses the primitive type double, but it also introduces the wrapper class Double. Also included is one of the most common Data Structures in Java, the ArrayList. These items are put together to create a grade calculator. . public class GradeCalculator { // introduction to Double wrapper class (object) ArrayList&lt;Double&gt; grades; // similar to Python list // constructor, initializes ArrayList and call enterGrades method public GradeCalculator() { this.grades = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); this.enterGrades(); } // double requires test for zero versus threshold, DO NOT compare to Zero private boolean isZero(double value){ double threshold = 0.001; return value &gt;= -threshold &amp;&amp; value &lt;= threshold; } // enterGrades input method using scanner private void enterGrades() { Scanner input; while (true) { input = new Scanner(System.in); System.out.print(&quot;Enter a double, 0 to exit: &quot;); try { double sampleInputDouble = input.nextDouble(); System.out.println(sampleInputDouble); if (isZero(sampleInputDouble)) break; // exit loop on isZero else this.grades.add(sampleInputDouble); // adding to object, ArrayList grades } catch (Exception e) { // if not a number System.out.println(&quot;Not an double (form like 9.99), &quot; + e); } input.close(); } } // average calculation public double average() { double total = 0; // running total for (double num : this.grades) { // enhanced for loop total += num; // shortcut add and assign operator } return (total / this.grades.size()); // double math, ArrayList grades object maintains its size } // static main method, used as driver and tester public static void main(String[] args) { GradeCalculator grades = new GradeCalculator(); // calls constructor, creates object, which calls enterGrades System.out.println(&quot;Average: &quot; + String.format(&quot;%.2f&quot;, grades.average())); // format used to standardize to two decimal points } } // IJava activation GradeCalculator.main(null); .

POJO Review . This code fragment shows power of Spring and Annotations to define a Model. Using Spring, a little bit of POJO code, the Developer is enabling persistent data storage of a table in a database. It is left to student to search up each annotation for personal clarification beyond the comments below. . import lombok.AllArgsConstructor; import lombok.Data; import lombok.NoArgsConstructor; import javax.persistence.*; @Data // Annotations to simplify writing code (ie constructors, setters) @NoArgsConstructor // Builds zero argument constructor @AllArgsConstructor // Builds constructor for all agurments @Entity // Annotation to simplify creating an entity, which is a lightweight persistence domain object. Typically, an entity represents a table in a relational database, and each entity instance corresponds to a row in that table. public class Jokes { @Id @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO) private Long id; // Unique identifier @Column(unique=true) private String joke; // The Joke private int haha; // Store joke likes private int boohoo; // Store joke jeers } . Java Persistence API (JPA) . The JPA code is defined to access the database. The JokesJpaRepository interface extends JpaRepository. This allows the developer access JPA predefined and developer custom interfaces to perform CRUD operations on persistent storage. It is left to student to define “Delete” operation in CRUD. . import java.util.List; import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository; // JPA is an object-relational mapping (ORM) to persistent data, originally relational databases (SQL). Today JPA implementations has been extended for NoSQL. public interface JokesJpaRepository extends JpaRepository&lt;Jokes, Long&gt; { // JPA has many built in methods, these few have been prototyped for this application void save(String Joke); // used for Create, Update operations in CRUD // Accessors, Read operations in CRUD List&lt;Jokes&gt; findAllByOrderByJokeAsc(); // returns a List of Jokes in Ascending order List&lt;Jokes&gt; findByJokeIgnoreCase(String joke); // look to see if Joke(s) exist } . JPA returns List . List is a super class to ArrayList. In the JPA code you can see that List of Jokes is common result from JPA accessor method. It is left to the student to review List and ArrayList from GeeksForGeeks and understand research difference between interface and implementation. . API Controller . This backend piece of the Spring process is building out the RESTful API services to access the data. Below is the JokesApiController, this is commented extensively. It is left for the student to review and update the “Spring API and ORM” illustration and add it to their personal blogging notes from the notes and code below. . @Autowired annotation provides full access to JokesJpaRepository, what we made with the code above. Review repository., there are actions for set, get, save and more. | @GetMapping and @PutMapping which establishes endpoints for RESTful web services to access the data. | API @PathVariable for obtaining information from the request URL. | The respones “return new ResponseEntity” returning JSON and Statis/ | . import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired; import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus; import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity; import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*; import java.util.List; import java.util.Optional; @RestController // annotation to simplify the creation of RESTful web services @RequestMapping(&quot;/api/jokes&quot;) // all requests in file begin with this URI public class JokesApiController { // Autowired enables Control to connect URI request and POJO Object to easily for Database CRUD operations @Autowired private JokesJpaRepository repository; /* GET List of Jokes * @GetMapping annotation is used for mapping HTTP GET requests onto specific handler methods. */ @GetMapping(&quot;/&quot;) public ResponseEntity&lt;List&lt;Jokes&gt;&gt; getJokes() { // ResponseEntity returns List of Jokes provide by JPA findAll() return new ResponseEntity&lt;&gt;( repository.findAll(), HttpStatus.OK); } /* Update Like * @PutMapping annotation is used for mapping HTTP PUT requests onto specific handler methods. * @PathVariable annotation extracts the templated part {id}, from the URI */ @PutMapping(&quot;/like/{id}&quot;) public ResponseEntity&lt;Jokes&gt; setLike(@PathVariable long id) { /* * Optional (below) is a container object which helps determine if a result is present. * If a value is present, isPresent() will return true * get() will return the value. */ Optional&lt;Jokes&gt; optional = repository.findById(id); if (optional.isPresent()) { // Good ID Jokes joke = optional.get(); // value from findByID joke.setHaha(joke.getHaha()+1); // increment value repository.save(joke); // save entity return new ResponseEntity&lt;&gt;(joke, HttpStatus.OK); // OK HTTP response: status code, headers, and body } // Bad ID return new ResponseEntity&lt;&gt;(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST); // Failed HTTP response: status code, headers, and body } /* Update Jeer */ @PutMapping(&quot;/jeer/{id}&quot;) public ResponseEntity&lt;Jokes&gt; setJeer(@PathVariable long id) { Optional&lt;Jokes&gt; optional = repository.findById(id); if (optional.isPresent()) { // Good ID Jokes joke = optional.get(); joke.setBoohoo(joke.getBoohoo()+1); repository.save(joke); return new ResponseEntity&lt;&gt;(joke, HttpStatus.OK); } // Bad ID return new ResponseEntity&lt;&gt;(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST); } } . Front End . This database was setup to allow people to HaHa or Boohoo a collection of Computer Jokes. The entirety has lot of limitation. . People can vote more than once and in both categories. | There is no auto refresh if several are voting and updating as you are looking at your static page. | Perhaps Q and A style could hide punch line. | Perhaps we could accept new jokes, or have interface for adding them. | . Amazingly, though … the front-end code is in a completely different project. The front end project GETs and PUTs using the back end APIs. The key element that makes this different than other public APIs, like RapidAPI, is the “reaction” function. This function updates the elementID of the like or jeer as soon as you impact the button. . Frontend JavaScript Code . // Reaction function to likes or jeers user actions function reaction(type, put_url, elemID) { // fetch the API fetch(put_url, put_options) // response is a RESTful &quot;promise&quot; on any successful fetch .then(response =&gt; { // check for response errors if (response.status !== 200) { error(&quot;PUT API response failure: &quot; + response.status) return; // api failure } // valid response will have JSON data response.json().then(data =&gt; { console.log(data); // Likes or Jeers updated/incremented if (type === HAHA) // like data element document.getElementById(elemID).innerHTML = data.haha; // fetched haha data assigned to haha Document Object Model (DOM) else if (type === BOOHOO) // jeer data element document.getElementById(elemID).innerHTML = data.boohoo; // fetched boohoo data assigned to boohoo Document Object Model (DOM) else error(&quot;unknown type: &quot; + type); // should never occur }) }) // catch fetch errors (ie Nginx ACCESS to server blocked) .catch(err =&gt; { error(err + &quot; &quot; + put_url); }); } . Hacks . AP required. Review the lambok annotations (https://projectlombok.org/features/). . Write the POJO and show code generated by lambok. Comment this code in context of requirements for the AP exam. | . PBL foundational. Establish a POJO, JPA and APIs in your own project. You can begin with Jokes. . Make new POJO attribute. Alert, I suggest deleting /volumes/sqlite.db each time you change schema. Schema changes are not ugraded automatically. | Make a new API endpoint. | Test your API using Postman. You should be able to test with localhost:port. | . Resources, recommended by ChatGPT . Spring Framework Documentation The official Spring Framework documentation is entirely free to access.

            "content": "Iteration . According to CollegeBoard, Iteration is a way to simplify code that would otherwise be repeated many times in succession. Using loops, we can finally implement complex algorithms and solutions to common problems that we weren’t able to before. . Iteration is repeating sequences to simplify code of advanced algorithms . Iteration accounts for 17.5%-22.5% of the APCSA AP Exam . 4.1: WHILE LOOPS . Learning Objective: Represent Iterative Processes using a while loop . Question: What is a loop and what are some real life examples of this (Setting a Song to repeat on your music player) . You know the i variable that you use for while/for loops? It actually has a name, loop control variable . int i = 0; // initialize loop control variable while (i &lt; 10) // checks the loop control variable { System.out.println(&quot;Doing some code&quot;); i++; // update the loop control variable } . // Popcorn Hack: Simplify the code segment below int i = 0; System.out.println(i); i++; System.out.println(i); i++; System.out.println(i); i++; System.out.println(i); i++; System.out.println(i); i++; /* Hint: // while (condition) { } for (condition) { } */ . int i = 0; while (i &lt; 5) { System.out.println(i); i++; } . Infinite loop . An infinite loop is when a while loop always evaluates to true. avoid this when you can because it’s probably not good for your computer. if this happens by accident, I recommend copying all code in the block and deleting the block. After you delete the code block, close and reopen the tab that the code block was in. . What’s wrong with this code block? . while (true) { System.out.print(&quot;CONTROL &quot;); } // DO NOT RUN THE CODE . Do While loop . What will this code block output? . // Quite shrimple int i = 0; do { System.out.print(&quot;Quite shrimple. &quot;); i++; } while (i &lt; -5); . In a do while loop, it will run the “do” once before it reaches the “while”, and at that point it will start to act like a while loop. . For loop . this is the standard structure of a for loop . for (initialization; Boolean expression; update) { System.out.println(&quot;Doing some code&quot;); } . Initialization will run at the start of the loop, boolean expression will get checked with every loop, and update runs after every loop. . How many times will this code print “Doing some code?” . for (int num = 1; num &lt;= 5; num++) { System.out.println(&quot;Doing some code&quot;); } . Doing some code Doing some code Doing some code Doing some code Doing some code . In this code, it creates the variable num at the start of the loop, it checks if num is less than or equal to 5 after each loop, and it adds 1 to num after each loop. . Enhanced for loop . this is essentially a javascript for loop, as it will iterate through a list and run code in the loop to each variable inside the list . int[] list = {1, 4, 6, 2}; for (int j : list) { System.out.print(j); System.out.print(&quot; &quot;); } . 1 4 6 2 . Break and Continue . In java there are breaks, but there are also continues. . Break . Breaks, as you likely already know, end a loop. They tend to be used with an if statement . How many times will this code print “Big guy?” . int i = 0; while (i &lt; 10) { System.out.println(&quot;Big guy&quot;); i++; if (i == 5) { break; } } . Continue . Continue will skip code for an iteration, but will still keep the loop running . int i = 0; while (i &lt; 10) { if (i == 5) { i++; // don&#39;t forget this, it creates an error similar to an infinite loop System.out.println(&quot;&quot;); continue; } System.out.println(i); i++; } . 4.3: Developing Algorithms Using Strings . Learning Objective: For algorithms in the context of a particular specification that involves String objects: . Methods in Java that help to MANIPULATE STRINGS . String.substring - Retrieves a particular portion of a String | String.equals - Comparees the content of two strings | String.length - Returns the length of a String | . public class Compare { public static void main(String[] args) { String string1 = &quot;Coding is cool!&quot;; String string2 = &quot;Coding is coding!&quot;; int minLength = Math.min(string1.length(), string2.length()); for (int i = 0; i &lt; minLength; i++) { String subString1 = string1.substring(0, i + 1); String subString2 = string2.substring(0, i + 1); if (subString1.equals(subString2)) { System.out.println(&quot;Common Prefix: &quot; + subString2); } } } } Compare.main(null) . Common Prefix: C Common Prefix: Co Common Prefix: Cod Common Prefix: Codi Common Prefix: Codin Common Prefix: Coding Common Prefix: Coding Common Prefix: Coding i Common Prefix: Coding is Common Prefix: Coding is Common Prefix: Coding is c Common Prefix: Coding is co . Where are the 3 methods in the above Java Cell and how do they contribute to the program’s functionality? . String word = &quot;supercalifragilisticexpialidocious&quot;; int count = 0; for (int i = 0; i &lt; word.length(); i++) { char letter = word.charAt(i); if (letter == &#39;a&#39; || letter == &#39;e&#39; || letter == &#39;i&#39; || letter == &#39;o&#39; || letter == &#39;u&#39;) { count++; } } System.out.println(&quot;The Number of vowels in &quot;&quot; + word + &quot; &quot; is &quot; + count); . What does word.length() do and how do we use it above? . What Boolean Operator is used? . public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { String word = &quot;Scooby Doo&quot;; String sub = &quot;Doo&quot;; boolean found = false; for (int i = 0; i &lt;= word.length() - sub.length(); i++) { String portion = word.substring(i, i + sub.length()); if (portion.equals(sub)) { found = true; } } if (found) { System.out.println(&quot;We found the Smaller String!&quot;); } else { System.out.println(&quot;We did not find the Smaller String! t Ruh Roh!&quot;); } } } Main.main(null) . We found the Smaller String! . String concatenation . String concatenation is when you want to add to strings together . String original = &quot;String&quot;; String reversed = &quot;&quot;; for (int i = 0; i &lt; original.length(); i++) { String single = original.substring(i,i+1); reversed = single + reversed; } System.out.println(&quot;Original String: &quot; + original); System.out.println(&quot;Reversed String: &quot; + reversed); . 4.4: Nested Iteration . Learning Objective: Represent nested iteration processes . Essential Knowledge: . Nested iteration is when an iteration statement appears inside the body of another iteration statement | The inner loop must complete all of its iterations before the outer loop can continue. | . Before uncommenting the code, guess what the output will look like: . (write your guess here) . public class NestedLoops{ public static void main(String[] args){ // for (int outer = 1; outer &lt; 5; outer++){ // for (int inner = 1; inner &lt; 3; inner++){ // System.out.print(inner + &quot; &quot;); // } // System.out.println(); // } } } NestedLoops.main(null) . What will the output of the code above be if we switch the loop headers (the stuff inside of the for loop)? . (Write your guess here) .

            "content": "U4 | Iteration . . 4.1 while Loops . . A while loop is a fundamental control structure in programming used for repeated execution of a block of code as long as a condition is true. | The loop starts by evaluating the condition. If the condition is true, the code inside the loop is executed. | After each iteration, the condition is re-evaluated, and if it’s still true, the loop continues. If the condition is false initially, the loop code is never executed. | While loops are used when you don’t know in advance how many times the loop needs to execute. | There’s a risk of infinite loops if the condition never becomes false, so be cautious. You can use variables and complex expressions as loop conditions. | It’s essential to update the loop control variable within the loop to prevent infinite loops. | While loops are typically used for tasks such as iterating over collections or waiting for a specific condition to be met. | You can always break out of a while loop prematurely using the break statement. | . Example of While Loops . public class PyramidPattern { public static void main(String[] args) { int height = 5; int row = 1; while (row &lt;= height) { int spaces = height - row; int stars = 2 * row - 1; // Print spaces int spaceCount = spaces; while (spaceCount &gt; 0) { System.out.print(&quot; &quot;); spaceCount--; } // Print stars int starCount = stars; while (starCount &gt; 0) { System.out.print(&quot;*&quot;); starCount--; } System.out.println(); // Move to the next line for the next row row++; } } } PyramidPattern.main(null); . 4.2 for Loops . . Iterative statement that checks for condition | Repeatedly execute a a block of code as long as the condition is met | Condition specifies amount of times | . for Loops vs. while Loops . while Loops: use when number of iterations is unknown | for Loops: use when number of iterations is known | . int i = 0; while (i &lt; 5) { System.out.println(i); i++; } . for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) { System.out.println(i); } . Three parts in for loop header: variable initialization, Boolean (conditional) expression, and increment/decrement statement | . Question: Which part is which? . variable initialization (int i=0): sets variable before loop starts | Boolean (conditional) expression (i &lt; 5): defines condition for loop to run, in this case, the loop continues as long as i is less than 5, so loops 5 times i 05 | increment/decrement statement (i++): increases variable each time code block in the loop is executed, in this case it increases by 1 | variable can be used in the code block for other various reasons besides specifying how many times the loop will repeat | Boolean (conditional) expression and increment/decrement statement together determine how many times the loop will repeat | . int sum = 0; int sum_all = 0; for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) { if (i % 2 == 0) sum += i; sum_all += i; } System.out.println(sum); System.out.println(sum_all); . 4.3 Developing Algorithms Using Strings . . LEARNING OBJECTIVES: For algorithms in the context of a particular specification that involves String objects: . identify standard algorithms | modify standard algorithms | develop an algorithm | . Java has many methods that are helpful when working with strings: . String .substring –&gt; retrieves portion of a string | String .equals –&gt; compares two strings | String .length –&gt; returns length of a string | for Loop –&gt; iterating through characters of a string | . . Finding a substring within a string . We can use the “window” method: . A “window” is created the same length as the substring. We then iterate through the main string in sections and compare to the substring . For example: . I T E R A T E . with substring “ERA” . . public class StringFinder { public static void main(String[] args) { String word = &quot;iterate&quot;; String sub = &quot;xxx&quot;; boolean found = false; // will be set to true once substring is found for (int i = 0; i &lt; word.length(); i++) { //iterating forwards: starting at first index (0) and going to the length of the word.. let&#39;s try word.length String portion = word.substring(i, i + sub.length()); if (sub.length() &gt; portion.length()) break; if (portion.equals(sub)) { // make sure you use .equals!! found = true; break; } } if (found) System.out.println(&quot;substring is found within string!&quot;); else System.out.println(&quot;substring is NOT within string&quot;); } } StringFinder.main(null); . POPCORN HACK: Run the code.. what happened? How can we fix it? . Tell us below! . . Another issue: . I T E R A T E . What if our substring was the word “RATE”? Note that RATE is at the end of the whole string . . HACKS . Create a algorithm similar to the one above. Except this time, use iteration to count the number of vowels within the main string. . HINT: Use the boolean expressions we have learned in previous lessons. Which would you use when comparing your “window” with multiple options of substrings? . 4.4 Nested Iteration . nested iteration . occurs when we have a loop inside of another loop, similar to nested conditional statements in unit 3 When you have one loop inside another, the inner loop has to finish all its rounds before the outer loop moves to the next round. If the inner loop has a &quot;stop&quot; command, it only stops for that round of the outer loop. The next time the outer loop starts a new round, the inner loop starts over. If you have two nested loops without stops, and the outer one runs n times while the inner one runs m times each time the outer one goes around, the inner loop will run m times n times, which is m * n times in total. This rule also applies if you have more than two nested loops. To find the total number of times the innermost loop runs, just multiply how many times each loop runs per round. java public class NestedLoopsDemo { public static void main(String[] args) { int n = 3; //numb of times the outside loop runs int m = 2; //numb of times the inside loop runs //the nested loops for (int i = 1; i &lt;= n; i++) { System.out.println(&quot;Outer loop iteration: &quot; + i); for (int j = 1; j &lt;= m; j++) { System.out.println(&quot;Inner loop iteration: &quot; + j); } } } } NestedLoopsDemo.main(null) ### Break Statement **break statement** is used to exit a loop prematurely, typically when a certain condition is met. In the case of nested loops, it can be used to break out of the innermost loop. java public class BreakExample { public static void main(String[] args) { for (int i = 1; i &lt;= 3; i++) { System.out.println(&quot;Outer loop iteration &quot; + i); for (int j = 1; j &lt;= 3; j++) { System.out.println(&quot;Inner loop iteration &quot; + j); if (i == 2 &amp;&amp; j == 2) { System.out.println(&quot;Breaking inner loop&quot;); break; //break out of the inside loop when i is 2 and j is 2. } } } } } BreakExample.main(null) ### Popcorn HACK When the targetNumber is found, you can print a message and use the break statement to exit the loop. When it&#39;s not found, you can print a message indicating that the number was not found. java public class BreakHack { public static void main(String[] args) { int targetNumber = 42; //numb we want int[] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70}; //numb array for (int number : numbers) { if (number == targetNumber) { //if numb is found //print message to break out loop } } //if numb isnt found //print message showing numb wasnt found if you want } } BreakHack.main ### Continue Statement **continue statement** is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In the case of nested loops, it applies to the innermost loop. java public class ContinueExample { public static void main(String[] args) { for (int i = 1; i &lt;= 3; i++) { System.out.println(&quot;Outer loop iteration &quot; + i); for (int j = 1; j &lt;= 3; j++) { if (i == 2 &amp;&amp; j == 2) { System.out.println(&quot;Skipping inner loop iteration &quot; + j); continue; //skip the iteration when i is 2 and j is 2. } System.out.println(&quot;Inner loop iteration &quot; + j); } } } } ContinueExample.main(null) ### Patterns and Shapes java import java.util.Scanner; public class InteractivePyramid { public static void main(String[] args) { Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in); System.out.print(&quot;Enter the symbol you want to use: &quot;); char symbol = scanner.next().charAt(0); System.out.print(&quot;Enter the number of rows for the pyramid: &quot;); int numRows = scanner.nextInt(); for (int i = 1; i &lt;= numRows; i++) { //print space before the symbol for (int j = 1; j &lt;= numRows - i; j++) { System.out.print(&quot; &quot;); } //print for (int k = 1; k &lt;= 2 * i - 1; k++) { System.out.print(symbol); } System.out.println(); //next line } scanner.close(); } } InteractivePyramid.main(null) ## Hacks 1. **Modify pyramid code:** - Create different patterns (other then pyramid) by modifying nested loop structure 2. **Questions** - What is a nested iteration, continue statement, and break statement (in your own words)? - Create a simple example of a continue statement **or** break statement # 4.5 Informal Code Analysis Learning objective: Compute statement execution counts &amp; informal run-time comparison of iterative statements Essential Knowledge: A statement execution count indicates the number of times a statement is executed by the program What IS informal code analysis? .

            "content": "Introduction . In this lesson, we will explore the various ways to create loops in Python. Loops are essential for repetitive tasks and are a fundamental concept in programming. We will cover different types of loops, advanced loop techniques, and how to work with lists and dictionaries using loops. . For Loops . Used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range) | Executes a block of code for each item in the sequence | . # APCSP Pseudo-Code: Iterating Over a List of Fruits fruits ← [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;cherry&quot;] FOR EACH fruit IN fruits: DISPLAY fruit END FOR . # Example 1: Simple for loop fruits = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;cherry&quot;] for fruit in fruits: print(fruit) . apple banana cherry . While Loops . Used to execute a block of code as long as a condition is true | . # APCSP Pseudo-Code: Using a While Loop to Count and Display Numbers i ← 1 WHILE i ≤ 5: DISPLAY i i ← i + 1 END WHILE . # Example 2: Simple while loop i = 1 while i &lt;= 5: print(i) i += 1 . 1 2 3 4 5 . Looping with Lists and Dictionaries . Used to iterate through the elements of lists and dictionaries | . # APCSP Pseudo-Code: Loop Through a List numbers ← [1, 2, 3, 4] FOR EACH num IN numbers: DISPLAY num END FOR # APCSP Pseudo-Code: Loop Through a Dictionary person ← {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;aashray&quot;, &quot;age&quot;: 15, &quot;city&quot;: &quot;San Diego&quot;} FOR EACH key, value IN person: DISPLAY key, &quot;:&quot;, value END FOR . # Example 3: Loop through a list numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4] for num in numbers: print(num) # Example 4: Loop through a dictionary person = {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;aashray&quot;, &quot;age&quot;: 15, &quot;city&quot;: &quot;San Diego&quot;} for key, value in person.items(): print(key, &quot;:&quot;, value) . 1 2 3 4 name : aashray age : 15 city : San Diego . Popcorn Hack 1 . Use a loop to get X amount of inputs. Then use a loop to find the type of each value. . | Extra Challenge: If an input is a number, make the corresponding value in the dictionary a number. . | . sample_dict = {} # Code goes here . Looping with Index Variable . You can use the range function to create a loop with an index variable. . # APCSP Pseudo-Code: Loop Through a List Using Index lst ← [4, 6, 7, 2] FOR i IN RANGE(LENGTH(lst)): DISPLAY &quot;Index: &quot; + STRING(i) DISPLAY &quot;Element: &quot; + STRING(GET_ELEMENT(lst, i)) END FOR . # Example 5: Loop with an index variable lst = [4, 6, 7, 2] for i in range(len(lst)): # Loop for the number of elements in the list print(&#39;Index: &#39; + str(i)) # Print the index print(&#39;Element: &#39; + str(lst[i])) # Print the element . Index: 0 Element: 4 Index: 1 Element: 6 Index: 2 Element: 7 Index: 3 Element: 2 . Nested If Statements . You can nest conditional statements inside a for loop to execute different code based on conditions. . # APCSP Pseudo-Code: For Loop with Nested If Statements numbers ← [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] FOR EACH num IN numbers: IF num MOD 2 EQUALS 0: DISPLAY num, &quot;is even&quot; ELSE: DISPLAY num, &quot;is odd&quot; END IF END FOR . # Example 6: For loop with nested if statements numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] for num in numbers: if num % 2 == 0: print(num, &quot;is even&quot;) else: print(num, &quot;is odd&quot;) . 1 is odd 2 is even 3 is odd 4 is even 5 is odd . Popcorn Hack 2 . Use the input() function to append a range of integers from a list . | Use a nested if statement to only print numbers in the list that are evenly divisble by 3 . | . nums = [] #Code goes here . Try/Except . Using a try and except block inside a loop can handle errors gracefully. . | Very useful for production code, even in frontend webapps . Ex: Giving an error page instead of dumping critical information on the webpage | . | . # APCSP Pseudo-Code: Handling Errors in a For Loop numbers ← [1, 2, &quot;three&quot;, 4, 0, &quot;five&quot;] FOR EACH item IN numbers: TRY: DISPLAY 10 / item CATCH ZeroDivisionError: DISPLAY &quot;Division by zero&quot; CATCH TypeError: DISPLAY &quot;Type error&quot; END TRY END FOR . numbers = [1, 2, &quot;three&quot;, 4, 0, &quot;five&quot;] for item in numbers: try: print(10 / item) except ZeroDivisionError: #Type of error: Dividing by Zero print(&quot;Division by zero&quot;) except TypeError: #Type of error: Dividing by something that isn&#39;t a number print(&quot;Type error&quot;) . 10.0 5.0 Type error 2.5 Division by zero Type error . Popcorn Hack 3 . Create a for loop that uses a try and except statement for an AttributeError | Use integers and a list to create scenarios where the loop will either print something expected or print an error message | CHALLENGE: Try using the math module for this error | . numbers = [] # Code goes here . Continue and Break . Continue statement skips the current iteration | Break statement exits the loop prematurely | . # APCSP Pseudo-Code: For Loop with Continue and Break numbers ← [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] FOR EACH num IN numbers: IF num EQUALS 3: CONTINUE IF num EQUALS 5: BREAK DISPLAY num END FOR . # Example 8: For loop with continue and break numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] for num in numbers: if num == 3: continue # Skip the number 3 if num == 5: break # Exit the loop when 5 is encountered print(num) . 1 2 4 . Nested For Loops . You can also put for loops within for loops | Allows for looping an exponential amount of times | . # APCSP Pseudo-Code: Nested Loops for Group Names groups ← [[&quot;advik&quot;, &quot;aashray&quot;], [&quot;akhil&quot;, &quot;srijan&quot;]] FOR EACH pair IN groups: FOR EACH person IN pair: DISPLAY person + &quot; is cool&quot; END FOR DISPLAY pair[0] + &quot; and &quot; + pair[1] + &quot; love to code code code&quot; END FOR . groups = [[&#39;advik&#39;, &#39;aashray&#39;], [&#39;akhil&#39;, &#39;srijan&#39;]] for pair in groups: for person in pair: print(person + &#39; is cool&#39;) print(pair[0] + &#39; and &#39; + pair[1] + &#39; love to code code code&#39;) . advik is cool aashray is cool advik and aashray love to code code code akhil is cool srijan is cool akhil and srijan love to code code code . (OPTIONAL) Popcorn Hack 4 . Create a nested for loop that iterates over a dictionary that has: A name for each key | A list for each value containing stuff like age, grade, etc. | . | Break/continue if certain conditions are met | Have fun! If you want to, relate it to a theme! | . people = {} # Code here . Iteration via Recursion . A technique where a function calls itself | Can be used to recreate loops until a certain condition is met | . # APCSP Pseudo-Code: Recursion for Factorial Calculation FUNCTION factorial(n): IF n EQUALS 0: RETURN 1 ELSE IF n LESS THAN 0: RETURN &quot;undefined&quot; ELSE IF TYPEOF(n) EQUALS &quot;float&quot;: RETURN &quot;not solvable without gamma function&quot; ELSE: RETURN n TIMES factorial(n - 1) END IF END FUNCTION result ← CALL factorial(5) DISPLAY &quot;Factorial of 5 is&quot;, result . # Example 9: Recursion for factorial calculation def factorial(n): if n == 0: #Conditions to stop the recursion return 1 # 0! is 1 elif n &lt; 0: return &quot;undefined&quot; # Undefined for negative numbers elif isinstance(n, float): return &quot;not solvable without gamma function&quot; # Only accept integers else: return n * factorial(n - 1) #Function calling itself result = factorial(5) print(&quot;Factorial of 5 is&quot;, result) .

            "content": "Flow of Information . The information in a code flows in a direction based on the loops and conditional statements written. . Control Statements . These statements determine the order in which the code is executed. Two major ways of writing control statements are using iteration and transfer statements. . Iteration . By: (Sumedha, Aditya, Ishraq, Grayson, Anthony) . What is iteration? . We use iteration when we need to repeat the same code for a multiple number of times. Iteration is the looping of data in a code sequence. In Python, iteration is done using While loops and For loops. . While loops . While loops are used when the looping depends on a condition. As long as the condition is true, the code will be executed. When the condition becomes false, the loop stops. . In a while loop, we need to specify the index value (where the loop starts) and the increment value (what the loop increases by). . i = 0 while i &lt; 5: print(i) i += 1 . Hack 1: . Write a code for printing even numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop. . i=0 # your code here print (i) . Transfer Functions . Statements which transfer control from one part of a program to another. Examples are: break, continue, and pass statements. . Break Funtion . To stop a code from printing after a certain value, use the break function. We use an if statement to decide where the output will stop. The break function is placed before the increment and after the if statement. . i = 1 while i &lt; 5: print(i) if i == 2: break i += 1 . Continue Function . To skip an output value and continue on to the end value, use the continue function. We use an if statement to decide which value should be skipped. The continue function is placed after both the increment and the if statement. . i = 0 while i &lt; 5: i += 1 if i == 2: continue print(i) . Hack 2: . Write a code to list the numbers from 1 to 20 while skipping the multiples of 2 using a while loop. . i = 0 # your code here print(i) . Pass Function . The pass function is like a placeholder after empty code has been written. When a pass statement is added, there will be no effect, but there will be no error message. If there is no pass statement, then an error message will appear. . for x in []: pass . Else Statements . If a condition isn’t true anymore, then we can write a code using an else statement which stops the iteration from continuing. . i = 1 while i &lt; 5: print(i) i += 1 else: print(&quot;i is no longer less than 5&quot;) . For Loops . For Loops are used to iterate over a group of values such as lists, strings, dictionaries, tuples, etc. . gemstones = [&quot;aquamarine&quot;, &quot;beryl&quot;, &quot;citrine&quot;] for x in gemstones: print(x) . Looping through Strings . We can iterate through strings by using a for loop that shows each character in the string. Example below: . for x in &quot;beryl&quot;: print(x) . Break Function . Using a break function, we can stop the loop from iterating when the output is a certain value. This is the same as in while loops. . gemstones = [&quot;aquamarine&quot;, &quot;beryl&quot;, &quot;citrine&quot;] for x in gemstones: print(x) if x == &quot;beryl&quot;: break . Continue Function . Using a continue function, we can skip an output value and continue the iteration till the end of the sequence. This is similar to while loops. . gemstones = [&quot;aquamarine&quot;, &quot;beryl&quot;, &quot;citrine&quot;] for x in gemstones: if x == &quot;beryl&quot;: continue print(x) . Range Function . Using a range function, we can iterate through a specific range of values. This function starts with zero and increments by 1, which it does automatically, and we specify exactly which values to iterate through. . for x in range(8): print(x) . We can define the starting value if it is other than zero by adding a second parameter. . for x in range(2,8): print(x) . We can also define the increment value by adding a third parameter. . for x in range(1,8,2): print(x) . Else Statements . We use else statements to signal when a code is done iterating through a set of values. It is used to code for a message which is printed to show when the iteration is complete. . for x in range(8): print(x) else: print(&quot;The code is finished!&quot;) . Nested Loops . Nested Loops are loops within loops. This is used to return an output which is a combination of the outer and inner loops. . for x in [1, 2]: print(x) for y in [2, 3, 4, 5]: print(y) . for i in range(4,6): print (i) for x in range(1,11): print (i, &quot;X&quot;, x, &quot;=&quot;, i * x) . Hack 3 . Write a code using a for loop that outputs numbers from 1 to 100 and skips multiples of 4. . Upper 90%: Add multiple parameters to specify your values. Use continue to skip the proper values. Double check outputs. . # Your code here . Homework . Create a function that takes a list of numbers and arranges the in descending order . For example this function should be able to take the list [35,4,6,90,2,55,13,8] and arrange it into [2,4,6,8,13.35,55,90] . Extra Credit . Make it so this function can also sort strings by their length For example [Car,4,11,twenty,27,trees] should sort into [Car,4,trees,twenty,11,27] . #start here def shortestToLongestSorter(nums): pass .",

Hack #1: Relational Operators . Create a program that takes two numbers from the user (use input()) and displays the larger one. If the numbers are equal, state that they are equal. Challenge: Use relational operators to compare two words and display whichever one comes first alphabetically (Can you apply it to a list?) . ## Program Here . Logic Gates . Logic gates combine different boolean (true/false or 1/0) values into a single boolean value. As computers are composed of a bunch of binary/boolean values, logic gates are the “logic” of the computer (the ability to code). . Boolean Operators + Algebra . The basic operators in Boolean algebra are AND, OR, and NOT. The secondary operators are eXclusive OR (often called XOR) and eXclusive NOR (XNOR, sometimes called equivalence). They are secondary in the sense that they can be composed from the basic operators. . AND . The AND of two values is true only whenever both values are true. It is written as AB or A⋅B. . A B A AND B . 0 | 0 | 0 | . 0 | 1 | 0 | . 1 | 0 | 0 | . 1 | 1 | 1 | . . Real-life example of AND: If it’s sunny (A) AND it’s a weekend (B), then I will go to the beach :) . Hack #2: AND in Python . Add an “else” statement to the current if-statement, and display an appropriate response for each block | Rename the two variables to a realistic scenario (i.e. sunny and weekend example above) | Change the two variables between True and False to see what output you’ll get! | (CHALLENGE): Make the code more user-friendly with “input()” | # CB Pseudo Code A ← true B ← true IF (A AND B) { DISPLAY(&quot;It&#39;s true!&quot;) } . # Python A = True B = True if A and B: # Bitwise syntax: A &amp; B print(&quot;It&#39;s true!&quot;) . It&#39;s true! . OR . The OR of two values is true whenever either or both values are true. It is written as A+B. The values of or for all possible inputs is shown in the following truth table . A B A OR B . 0 | 0 | 0 | . 0 | 1 | 1 | . 1 | 0 | 1 | . 1 | 1 | 1 | . . Real-life example of OR: If it’s my birthday (A) OR it’s Christmas (B), then I will get a present :D . Optional Hack: OR in Python . Add an else statement to create output appropriately | Try different combinations of A and B | # CB Pseudo Code A ← true B ← false IF (A OR B) { DISPLAY(&quot;It&#39;s true!&quot;) } . # Python A = True B = False if A or B: # Bit-mask syntax: A | B print(&quot;It&#39;s true!&quot;) . It&#39;s true! True . NOT . The NOT of a value is its opposite; that is, the not of a true value is false whereas the not of a false value is true. It is written as [x with a dash above] or ¬x. . A NOT A . 0 | 1 | . 1 | 0 | . . Real-life example of NOT: If I do NOT eat dessert (A), then I will be sad ;-; . Hack #3: NOT in Python . Follow the “AND in Python” hack to add an else statement to output when gate returns false, and change the program to apply in real life | Try different combinations of A | (CHALLENGE): Combine the NOT logic gate with the AND logic gate and the OR logic gate from above | # CB Pseudo Code A ← false IF (NOT A) { DISPLAY(&quot;It&#39;s true!&quot;) } . # Python A = False if not A: # No equivalent bitwise syntax in python print(&quot;It&#39;s true!&quot;) . It&#39;s true! . XOR . The XOR of two values is true whenever the values are different. It uses the ⊕ operator, and can be built from the basic operators: x⊕y = x(not y) + (not x)y . A B A XOR B . 0 | 0 | 0 | . 0 | 1 | 1 | . 1 | 0 | 1 | . 1 | 1 | 0 | . . Real-life example of XOR: If I play video games (A) XOR I watch a movie (B), I will be entertained :O . Another example: There is a light connected to two switches. If the first switch is on (A) XOR the second switch is on (B), then the light will turn on. Note here that flipping either switch (changing either input) changes the output. . The XOR gate is often use in binary calculators as well, because if two ones results in a zero, and an AND gate can be used to calculate the next bit. . Hack #4: XOR in Python . Follow the “AND in Python” hack to add else output | Try different combinations of A and B | (CHALLENGE): Assuming True is 1 and False is 0, write an expression that takes two inputs and outputs the result of a XOR gate | # CB Pseudo Code A ← false B ← true IF (A XOR B) { DISPLAY(&quot;It&#39;s true!&quot;) } . # Python A = False B = True if A ^ B: # Only bitwise syntax, no &quot;xor&quot; keyword print(&quot;It&#39;s true!&quot;) . It&#39;s true! . NAND . NAND is the NOT of the result of AND. In other words, the result of NAND is true if at least one value is false. . A B A NAND B . 0 | 0 | 1 | . 0 | 1 | 1 | . 1 | 0 | 1 | . 1 | 1 | 0 | . . Real-life example of NAND: If I forget my computer (A) NAND I forget my phone (B), I can access the internet :P . Optional Hack: NAND in Python . Follow the “AND in Python” hack to make the code applicable to a real-life example (e.g. forgetting your phone NAND forgetting your computer). | Try different combinations of A and B | Follow the “AND in Python” hack to add else output | # CB Pseudo Code A ← false B ← true IF (NOT (A AND B)) { DISPLAY(&quot;It&#39;s true!&quot;) } . # Python A = False B = True if not (A and B): print(&quot;It&#39;s true!&quot;) . It&#39;s true! . NOR . NOR is the NOT of the result of OR. In other words, the result of NOR is true if and only if both values are false. . A B A NOR B . 0 | 0 | 1 | . 0 | 1 | 0 | . 1 | 0 | 0 | . 1 | 1 | 0 | . . Real-life example of NOR: If there’s a fire (A) NOR there’s an earthquake (B) then I’ll be ok :S . Optional Hack: NOR in python . Follow the “AND in Python” hack to make the code applicable to a real-life example (e.g. there’s a fire NOR there’s an earthquake). | Try different combinations of A and B | Follow the “AND in Python” hack to add else output | # CB Pseudo Code A ← false B ← true IF (NOT (A OR B)) { DISPLAY(&quot;It&#39;s true!&quot;) } . # Python A = False B = True if not (A or B): print(&quot;It&#39;s true!&quot;) . It&#39;s true! . De-Morgan’s Law . An OR (AND) expression that is negated is equal to the AND (OR) of the negation of each term. . NOT (A AND B) = (NOT A) OR (NOT B) . Using same beach example as above: If it is sunny OR it is a weekend, I will go the beach (A AND B). If I go to the beach, I will NOT stay home. | The above can be simplified to if it is NOT sunny (A), OR NOT a weekend (B), I will stay home. | . | . NOT (A OR B) = (NOT A) AND (NOT B) . If it is NOT (my birthday (A) OR Christmas (B)), then I don’t get a present | The above is the same as if it is NOT my birthday (A) AND NOT Christmas (B), then I don’t get a present | . Homework Hacks . There is one more logic gate, known as an XNOR, or exclusive-NOR gate. It is a combination of an XOR and a NOT gate. Create a table like the ones above to demonstrate input and output values of this gate. . | Create python functions for three of the above logic gates. Implement two of them in an interactive program (with input) with a purpose. . | Bob is grading homework from a peer teaching project. He needs to mark a student’s homework as incomplete if they did NOT complete all the problems, OR did NOT submit it on time.

            "content": "Spring Security using Java Web Tokens Competition . JWT Hello Articles | . JWT concepts via ChatGPT with added illustrations . JSON Web Token (JWT) is a popular way to authenticate users in a web application. It is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is digitally signed using JSON Web Signature (JWS). Here is an example of how you might use JWT for authentication in a JavaScript application: . The client sends a login request to the server with the user’s credentials (e.g., username and password). Client/Origin: https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/APCSA/data/login | Server/Host: https://spring.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/ | . | If the credentials are valid, the server generates a JWT and sends it back to the client. Here ae some sample credentials. Sec-Fetch-Mode: cors | Sec-Fetch-Site: cross-site | . | The client stores the JWT in a cookie. Here is cookie in Chrome Inspect properties | . | For subsequent requests, the client sends the JWT in the Authorization header. Here is a sample JWT. jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJqbTEwMjFAZ21haWwuY29tIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc1ODA0MTg2LCJpYXQiOjE2NzU3ODYxODZ9.rHoLxTcBJOBv36gH5qNI1VhgGv2Jub1OPtpddf1-fHd84BcL5MeGxiBhi2M0MpEJcuhTjeC2TYWVaOjT7ek0tg; Path=/; Max-Age=3600; Expires=Tue, 07 Feb 2023 17:09:46 GMT; Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=None; Secure | . | The server verifies the JWT and, if it is valid, allows the request to proceed. Here is successful response. | . | The JWT consists of three parts, separated by dots (.). The first part is the header, which specifies the algorithm used to sign the JWT (e.g., HS256). The second part is the payload, which contains the claims. The third part is the signature, which is used to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it claims to be and to ensure that the message wasn’t changed along the way. . It is important to use HTTPS when transmitting JWTs to ensure that the JWT is not intercepted by an attacker. It is also a good idea to use short-lived JWTs (e.g., with an expiration time of one hour) and to refresh them frequently to reduce the risk of unauthorized access. . Storing JWT . There are a few different options for storing a JWT in a JavaScript application: . Cookies: You can store the JWT in a cookie and send it back to the server with each request. This is a simple and widely-supported option, but it has some limitations. For example, you can’t access cookies from JavaScript on a different domain, and some users may have cookies disabled in their browser settings. | Local storage: You can store the JWT in the browser’s local storage (localStorage) or session storage (sessionStorage). This option allows you to access the JWT from JavaScript on the same domain, but it is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, where an attacker can inject malicious code into your application and steal the JWT from the storage. | HttpOnly cookie: You can store the JWT in an HttpOnly cookie, which is a cookie that can only be accessed by the server and not by client-side JavaScript. This option provides some protection against XSS attacks, but it is still vulnerable to other types of attacks, such as cross-site request forgery (CSRF). | ChatGPT says … It is generally recommended to use a combination of options to provide the best security for your application. For example, you could store the JWT in an HttpOnly cookie and also in local storage, and use JavaScript to send the JWT from local storage to the server with each request. This way, you can still access the JWT from JavaScript on the same domain, while also protecting against XSS attacks. . However, for this implementation we have used #3 HttpOnly Cookie. . Key Configuration Areas . Nginx configuration snippet (Client to this Server) . Nginx.

Authenticate with JWT in a JavaScript application . This example sends a POST request to the /authorize endpoint with the user’s credentials in the request body. If the login was successful, the server will return a 200 OK response with the JWT set to Application properties. . /// URL for deployment var url = &quot;https://spring.nighthawkcodingsociety.com&quot; // Comment out next line for local testing // url = &quot;http://localhost:8085&quot; // Authenticate endpoint const login_url = url + &#39;/authenticate&#39;; function login_user(){ // Set body to include login data const body = { email: document.getElementById(&quot;uid&quot;).value, password: document.getElementById(&quot;password&quot;).value, }; // Set Headers to support cross origin const requestOptions = { method: &#39;POST&#39;, mode: &#39;cors&#39;, // no-cors, *cors, same-origin cache: &#39;no-cache&#39;, // *default, no-cache, reload, force-cache, only-if-cached credentials: &#39;include&#39;, // include, *same-origin, omit body: JSON.stringify(body), headers: { &quot;content-type&quot;: &quot;application/json&quot;, }, }; // Fetch JWT fetch(login_url, requestOptions) .then(response =&gt; { // trap error response from Web API if (!response.ok) { const errorMsg = &#39;Login error: &#39; + response.status; console.log(errorMsg); return; } // Success!!! // Redirect to Database location window.location.href = &quot;/APCSA/data/database&quot;; }) } . You can then use the JWT for authentication in subsequent fetch requests as the browser sends JWT in the Authorization header. Here is an example, but there is Nothing Unique in this example. . // prepare HTML result container for new output const resultContainer = document.getElementById(&quot;result&quot;); // prepare URL var url = &quot;https://spring.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/person/&quot;; // Uncomment next line for localhost testing // url = &quot;http://localhost:8085/api/person/&quot;; // set options for cross origin header request const options = { method: &#39;GET&#39;, // *GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. mode: &#39;cors&#39;, // no-cors, *cors, same-origin cache: &#39;default&#39;, // *default, no-cache, reload, force-cache, only-if-cached credentials: &#39;include&#39;, // include, *same-origin, omit headers: { &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;, }, }; // fetch the API fetch(url, options) // response is a RESTful &quot;promise&quot; on any successful fetch .then(response =&gt; { // check for response errors and display if (response.status !== 200) { const errorMsg = &#39;Database response error: &#39; + response.status; console.log(errorMsg); const tr = document.createElement(&quot;tr&quot;); const td = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); td.innerHTML = errorMsg; tr.appendChild(td); resultContainer.appendChild(tr); return; } // valid response will contain json data response.json().then(data =&gt; { console.log(data); for (const row of data) { // tr and td build out for each row const tr = document.createElement(&quot;tr&quot;); const name = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); const id = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); const age = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); // data is specific to the API name.innerHTML = row.name; id.innerHTML = row.email; age.innerHTML = row.age; // this build td&#39;s into tr tr.appendChild(name); tr.appendChild(id); tr.appendChild(age); // add HTML to container resultContainer.appendChild(tr); } }) }) // catch fetch errors (ie ACCESS to server blocked) .catch(err =&gt; { console.error(err); const tr = document.createElement(&quot;tr&quot;); const td = document.createElement(&quot;td&quot;); td.innerHTML = err + &quot;: &quot; + url; tr.appendChild(td); resultContainer.appendChild(tr); }); .

            "title": "ChatGPT in Java",
            "content": "Overview . ChatGPT is a pretty useful AI model to access in your code without having to create your own model. Essentially, this tutorial will give you a pretty good idea of how to directly access the API in Java. Also, all this was written by me, Bailey, but Don also did a lot with getting this implementation to work. . Steps: . Get access to an API Key | Store the API Key securely in the code | Create a fetch request to the API in Java | And that’s really it. . Step 1: Get access to an API Key . Basically, not just anybody can access the ChatGPT API; you need a secret key to be allowed access to the API. Luckily, it’s pretty easy to get one. . Create an Open AI account (link here). | Go to your personal list of API keys (link here). | Select “create new secret key” | Copy the given API key and store it somewhere | Note: Make sure to store the API key in somewhere safe, but you CANNOT leave this key in plaintext in a file and push it to the Github repository. Open AI will automatically detect the presence of this key and disable it for security reasons. If this ever happens, just create a new secret key. There are no penalties for this. . Go to “Billing” and set up a paid account | Yes, you will have to pay money to use the API. It turns out that Open AI doesn’t want you to use their all-powerful AI willy-nilly without a price, but luckily it doesn’t cost that much. This billing relies on a token system, which is a bit confusing, but the gist of it is that you spend a certain amount of tokens everytime you make a request to ChatGPT (I believe the token cost is based on the number of words in the prompt, but I’m not too sure to be honest; this article explains it well). As long as you don’t completely abuse the API, you’ll be paying less than $0.50 per month. Plus, I think they also give you $5 for the first 3 months, which is nice. In any case, don’t worry about running out of money. . Step 2: Store the API Key securely in the code . If you want to just have fun accessing ChatGPT from Java without using it in a final deployed project, you can just skip this step. You can just probably put the key in plaintext and it won’t complain as long as it isn’t pushed to the repostiory. This step is only necessary if you want to access ChatGPT safely and securely for a deployed project. . Unfortunately, this was the most painful part of getting everything to work. There are really two ways of doing this that we know of. The first involves storing the API key inside the Github repository and directly accessing it inside the code. The second involves adding a plaintext file with the API key onto the repo but then adding it into .gitignore and using a file reader to access the key. . In theory, the first method should be the correct way to do things, but we couldn’t get it to work for whatever reason. The steps will be listed below, but if you want a method that’s guaranteed to work (though may be slightly scuffed) you can just skip these. . Go to the backend Github repository. | Access settings (note that only contributers with admin permissions are allowed to access settings). | Access secrets, then access environmental variables | Copy and paste your API key into a newly created environmental variable | Access the variable through a .yml file | Step 5 is what we were struggling on. Whether it be some issue with the environmental variable itself or the way we accessed it in the .yml file, we couldn’t get it to work. . Instead, as an alternative, we (more like Don) utilized .gitignore to store the file without it being pushed to the main repo and a file reader to read that file with these steps below: . Create a .txt file on the AWS local server with just the key inside of it | (I’m going to be honest, this part was a bit confusing for me, because I didn’t actually do it, Don did. But essentially it works because the deployed website will read from the .txt file on the AWS server and not from the pushed version on the repo) . Add the .txt file to .gitignore | This part may seem a bit complicated, but it really isn’t that bad. You can just add the below to the bottom of your .gitignore and everything should be fine. . ### VSCODE ### .vscode/ key.txt . Obviously, key.txt should be the name of your file. . And this should prevent key.txt from being pushed into the repository, so everything’s good. . Create a file reader to read the file (written by Don) | Create a class file and name it something related to reading the file. In this case we named it KeyFileReader. You could reasonably put your key reader as a function inside the class calling the ChatGPT API. First you create a string with the file path to your key.txt file (NOTE: the file path should be based on the root being your repo; for instance, the path for the following code is “src/main/java/com/nighthawk/spring_portfolio/database/chat/key.txt”). Then we create a try except case using a BufferedReader object that passes in a FileReader objectto read a file. Then we use a while loop to wait for the file to be read before returning the key which is the first line in key.txt. We return the error in case anything goes wrong. . public class KeyFileReader { public static String getKey() { String filePath = &quot;src/main/java/com/nighthawk/spring_portfolio/database/chat/key.txt&quot;; try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) { String line; while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { // Process first line in the file (key) return line; } } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } return &quot;error&quot;; } } . We can simply call the class in our ChatGPT file to then access the key. . String API_KEY = KeyFileReader.getKey(); . Step 3: Create a fetch request to the API in Java . This step is pretty easy, all you have to do is set up an HttpURLConnection object with the right properties and make the request. The HttpURLConnection class can basically be thought of as an equivalent to the fetch() function in Javascript, only now you have to set all the parameters of the fetch call using methods instead of parameters. . Next you set up a JSONObject object with the right properties to specify the model, prompt, maximum tokens (limit), and temperature (variability), just like the HttpURLConnection object. . Finally, you have to actually call the API with the HttpURLConnection methods .setDoOutput() and .getOutputStream() while writing the JSON data to it, then you can use some strange navigating through the output of the call to actually get the text you want. I wouldn’t worry too much about this last part, it’s easier just to copy than try to decipher exactly what it’s doing. Just know that it’s just accessing the text you want from the mess of data. . public class Chat { public static String daVinciTest(String text) throws MalformedURLException, IOException { String url = &quot;https://api.openai.com/v1/completions&quot;; HttpURLConnection con = (HttpURLConnection) new URL(url).openConnection(); con.setRequestMethod(&quot;POST&quot;); con.setRequestProperty(&quot;Content-Type&quot;, &quot;application/json&quot;); con.setRequestProperty(&quot;Authorization&quot;, &quot;Bearer &quot; + KeyFileReader.getKey()); JSONObject data = new JSONObject(); data.put(&quot;model&quot;, &quot;text-davinci-003&quot;); data.put(&quot;prompt&quot;, text); data.put(&quot;max_tokens&quot;, 4000); data.put(&quot;temperature&quot;, 1.0); con.setDoOutput(true); con.getOutputStream().write(data.toString().getBytes()); String output = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(con.getInputStream())).lines() .reduce((a, b) -&gt; a + b).get(); return (new JSONObject(output).getJSONArray(&quot;choices&quot;).getJSONObject(0).getString(&quot;text&quot;)); } } . And that’s it . That’s really the basic steps to use the ChatGPT API in Java. Obviously, there’s a lot more configuring that can be done though. You can mess with the prompts, the models, the number of times used, and basically whatever you can imagine. . For our own website, we heavily took advantage of the ChatGPT API for half of our features and customized the calls in many ways to make it fun, which you can find at Rizz AI (I’m not sure if the website will still be up for long though). . One thing that you may have noticed is that the model used in this tutorial is actually davinci-003, and not gpt-3.5-turbo (which is closer to the actual model used in ChatGPT). There are only subtle differences between the two, so if you don’t care that much then davinci-003 will serve you well, but for those of you seeking gpt-3.5-turbo, unfortunately we could not get it to work with this Java implementation. Instead, we decided to use a Python implementation of the API call and then use a Python reader in Java to actually access its output. Unfortunately though, I (Bailey) have no idea how Don did it, and I don’t really feel like explaining all too much, since there are much better tutorials out there for ChatGPT API calls in Python (but maybe Don will write that part later). . But, if everything went well, you should be able to access ChatGPT in your own deployed website and abuse it for whatever nefarious purposes you have. Congratulations! .",

            "content": "Unit 2.1- Objects: Instances of Classes . What are objects? . An Object is created from a class by calling the class constructor. . What are classes? . A Class is a template that defines an object is like and what it can do. . Objects are Instances of Classes . For example, if the class is a blueprint for a house, the object is a particular house. . Example . Here is an example of creating a Student class in Java. It contains instance variables that define the characteristics of a student. . public class Student { // instance variables String name; String teacher; int period; // constructor public Student(String name, String teacher, int period) { this.name = name; this.teacher = teacher; this.period = period; } } . Now, using our class, we can create student objects by initializing two students . Student grace = new Student(&quot;Grace&quot;, &quot;Mr. Mort&quot;, 3); Student alice = new Student(&quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Mr. Mort&quot;, 1); . We can printout information about each student . System.out.println(grace.name); . Grace . System.out.println(alice.period); . 1 . Learning Objectives . Explain the relationship between a class and an object. | . Answer A class in object-oriented programming serves as a blueprint or template, defining the structure and behavior of objects. Objects, on the other hand, are instances of a class, representing real-world entities or concepts in code. Each object created from a class inherits its attributes and methods, allowing multiple objects to share a common structure while having their own unique data and behaviors. Essential Knowledge . An object is a specific instance of a class with defined attributes. | A class is the formal implementation, or blueprint, of the attributes and behaviors of an object. | . Unit 2.2- Creating and Storing Objects (Instantiation) . So, after we learned about classes, how are objects actually made? . Using our previous code, we can see created our constructor using . public Student(String name, String teacher, int period) { this.name = name; this.teacher = teacher; this.period = period; } . public class Student { // instance variables String name; String teacher; int period; // constructor public Student(String name, String teacher, int period) { this.name = name; this.teacher = teacher; this.period = period; } } . The Student is the name of the class. The first letter is capitalized according to Java naming conventions (camel-case naming conventions). Then, using the new keyword, we call the constructor to make a new Student. Inside the parentheses, we have the parameter list, where the values and characteristics of the object are entered. . Student grace = new Student(&quot;Grace&quot;, &quot;Mr. Mort&quot;, 3); . The parameters in this case are “Grace”, “Mr. Mort”, and 3. . Constructor Overloads . A class can have multiple constructors, however, the number of parameters must be different or the order must be different. This is an example of overloading the constructor. . // Constructor 1 Student(String name, String teacher, int period) // Constructor 2 Student(String teacher, String name, int period) . This two constructors are not allowed. For example, if we call . Student(&quot;Grace&quot;, &quot;Mr. Mort&quot;, 3); . we would not know whether Grace or Mr. Mort is the student. . However, constructors with different data types or different number of parameters are allowed when overloading. Here are some examples… . Student(String name, String teacher, int period) Student(String name, String teacher) Student() . Null Objects . Student rachit = null; . Null basically states that no object exists, and it is not stored in memory. You cannot call methods on an object that is declared as null since null objects do not have any information or characteristics set to that object. This will create a NullPointerException . Learning Objectives . Identify, using its signature, the correct constructor being called. | Note: Method Signature in java is defined as the structure of a method that is designed by the programmer | . public class Student { // instance variables String name; String teacher; int period; // constructor public Student(String name, String teacher, int period) { this.name = name; this.teacher = teacher; this.period = period; } } . Answer Student(&quot;Grace&quot;, &quot;Mr. Mort&quot;, 3); - For creating objects: (a) Create objects by calling constructors without parameters. (b) Create objects by calling constructors with parameters. - Define variables of the correct types to represent reference data. Unit 2.3- Calling a Void Method . method: code that is called in order to achieve a task . can be void or non-void, static or non-static | . void method: do not return a value but instead change other things. These include changing characteristics of an object or printing text to the console. Here is an example… . public void methodName(parameterList) . static method: general to the class and not tied to any particular object. The method is denoted by the Here is an example … . public static void add() { count++; } . To call a static method, we use dot notation, with the class name coming before the method separated by a dot as follows . ClassName.add(); . non-static method: acts on a particular object. For example, printing a person’s name is a non-static method, since each person has a different name. For example… . public void printName() { System.out.println(name); } . When calling a non-static method, we also use dot notation. But, instead of using the class name, we use the object name so we know what object the method acts on. Also, we don’t need to do dot notation of ClassName.objectName.methodName() because an object already acts on a certain class, so using the class name is just redundant. We would use printName() as follows… . objectName.printName(); . Run the main method and see what the each of the methods prints out . public class MyClass { // Static method public static void staticMethod() { System.out.println(&quot;This is a static method.&quot;); } // Non-static (instance) method public void nonStaticMethod() { System.out.println(&quot;This is a non-static method.&quot;); } // Method with void return type public void methodWithVoidReturnType() { System.out.println(&quot;This method has a void return type.&quot;); } public static void main(String[] args) { // Calling the static method staticMethod(); // Creating an object of MyClass MyClass myObject = new MyClass(); // Calling the non-static method on the object myObject.nonStaticMethod(); // Calling the method with void return type myObject.methodWithVoidReturnType(); } } . Learning Objective . Call non-static void methods without parameters. | . Unit 2.4- Calling a Void Method With Parameters . The method signature for writing void method with parameters is the same as a constructor, with the name of the method followed by the parameters and their types in parentheses. For example, here is a method that prints the perimeter of a rectangle… . public static void printRectanglePerimeter(double length, double width) { System.out.println(2 * (length + width)); } . printRectanglePerimeter(1.5, 2.5); . 8.0 . We can also overload methods as well. This overloading of the method is acceptable because there are different numbers of parameters. . // If 2 parameters are given, we will calculate the perimeter by adding the length and width and doubling it public static void printRectanglePerimeter(double length, double width) { System.out.println(2 * (length + width)); } // If 1 parameter is given, we assume the shape is a square public static void printRectanglePerimeter(double side) { System.out.println(4 * side); } // No shape exists, no perimeter is calculated public static void printRectanglePerimeter() { System.out.println(0); } . Unit 2.5- Calling a Non-Void Method . Void methods: complete actions and represent tasks. They are used when you want a method to perform a task or operation without producing a result that needs to be used elsewhere in your program. Void methods are typically used for actions like printing a message, updating a data structure, or modifying the state of an object. . Format for a non-void method: . public (static) dataType methodName(parameterListOptional) . Which method in this class is a non-void method? Edit the cell below to call the Calculator method. . public class Calculator { // A non-void method that adds two numbers and returns the result public int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; } public static void main(String[] args) { Calculator calculator = new Calculator(); // Calling the non-void method and capturing the result int sum = calculator.add(5, 3); // Printing the result System.out.println(&quot;Sum: &quot; + sum); // Output: Sum: 8 } } Calculator.main(null) . Sum: 8 . 2.6 String Objects: Concatenation, Literals, and More . Guess what’s crazy? String literals are not actually primitives, they are considered objects! String literals are part of the aptly named String class included in Java and have a set of methods that come along with it. We’ll see what we can do with the String class in the next topic! . There are two ways to make strings: using a preinitialized string or by using a constructor. . String preInt = &quot;Hello World!&quot;; // How we usually initialize strings System.out.println(preInt); // Using a constructor: String newString = new String(&quot;Hello World!&quot;); System.out.println(newString); . Hello World! Hello World! . Escape Characters . Sometimes, you want to put a quote in a string. However, you quickly find out that the opening quotation in the quote marks the “end” of the string and you can’t type out your quote unless you want the program to crash. What can you do? . . Challenge: Display the background of the quote while displaying the quote in one line: “Give me liberty or give me death!” - Patrick Henry. . System.out.println(&quot;This is a famous quote written by Patrick Henry in the Virginia Convention: n &quot;Give me liberty or give me death! &quot;&quot;) . This is a famous quote written by Patrick Henry in the Virginia Convention: &quot;Give me liberty or give me death!&quot; . String Concatenation . When we combine two strings together, we call that string concatenation. We use the ‘+’ operator to concatenate two strings. . System.out.println(&quot;I am&quot; + &quot;hungry&quot;); . I amhungry . Notice how there is no space between am and hungry. This is because the java ‘+’ operator does not add a space, but instead, joins the strings together without adding anything in between. To fix this, we add a space in between. . System.out.println(&quot;I am&quot; + &quot; &quot; + &quot;hungry&quot;); . I am hungry . However, when we want to use variables with our strings, we can also use the ‘+=’ operator to concatenate our strings. The ‘+’ operator still works, however. . String a1 = &quot;Hello &quot;; String a2 = &quot;World&quot;; System.out.println(a1 + a2); System.out.println(a1 += a2); . Hello World Hello World . Can you guess what happens when we try to change a string object? . String s1 = &quot;Hello&quot;; // String literal String s2 = &quot;Hello&quot;; // String literal String s3 = s1; // same reference //Changing the value of s1 s1 = &quot;Java&quot;; //Updating with concat() operation s2.concat(&quot; World&quot;); //The concatenated String will be created as a new instance and an object should refer to that instance to get the concatenated value. String newS3 = s3.concat(&quot; Scaler&quot;); System.out.println(&quot;s1 refers to &quot; + s1); System.out.println(&quot;s2 refers to &quot; + s2); System.out.println(&quot;s3 refers to &quot; + s3); System.out.println(&quot;newS3 refers to &quot; + newS3); . s1 refers to Java s2 refers to Hello s3 refers to Hello newS3 refers to Hello Scaler . The strings are immutable! This is because immutable strings allows Java to be safe in multithread applications (no changes that were not supposed to happen at that time in the program), and it makes the string object very efficient, as the strings are stored in a “string pool” that Java uses, which allows strings to only be created once but used over and over again if the same string object is created multiple times. . One last cool thing about strings is that primitive types change to string objects when concatenated. You have been doing this all the time, but here is the proof! . String message = &quot;Here is the key: &quot;; double key = 0.5; System.out.println(message + key) . Here is the key: 0.5 . 2.7 String Methods . Intro to External Libraries and APIs . There is a lot you can do with the factory version of Java, however, just like Python and many other languages, there are many new things you can do with the Java external libraries and APIs (application program interfaces). All Java classes, libraries, and APIs come with documentation, which lists the methods of the class and also how to use the class and its methods. Here is the official Java documentation for the String class: . Java Docs . Courtesy of Java. . About the String Class . The String class is a class in the java.lang package that comes when you install Java on your computer. . Accessing Substrings . With strings, we can access substrings and characters in the string. A substring is a string that is included within a larger string, and a character is a substring with a length of 1. First, we need to figure out the length of a string, which is the number of characters in the string. To do this, we use the following method: . String str = &quot;Kaiden Do&quot;; System.out.println(str.length()) . 9 . We can also get a index for the strings. For example, if we take “Kaiden Do”… . Index Character . 0 | K | . 1 | a | . 2 | i | . 3 | d | . 4 | e | . 5 | n | . 6 |   | . 7 | D | . 8 | o | . String str = &quot;Kaiden Do&quot;; System.out.println(str.substring(0, 6)); // Range is [_,_) System.out.println(str.substring(7, 9)); // Range is [_,_) . Kaiden Do . How would we get the nth character of a string? Write a program to find it with an integer n that you can change to get the nth character in the cell below. . String str = &quot;Pizza is yummy&quot;; int n = 1; System.out.println(str.substring(n - 1, n)); . P . Question: If we have a string, what is its lower bound index and what is its upper bound index, if the string length is equal to the variable ‘str’? . Answer: . Lower Bound Index: 0 . Upper Bound Index: str - 1 . Question: What is the error for an out of bound string? Display it in the cell below. . String str = &quot;Hello&quot;; System.out.println(str.substring(0, 1000)) . java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException: Range [0, 1000) out of bounds for length 5 at java.base/jdk.internal.util.Preconditions$1.apply(Preconditions.java:55) at java.base/jdk.internal.util.Preconditions$1.apply(Preconditions.java:52) at java.base/jdk.internal.util.Preconditions$4.apply(Preconditions.java:213) at java.base/jdk.internal.util.Preconditions$4.apply(Preconditions.java:210) at java.base/jdk.internal.util.Preconditions.outOfBounds(Preconditions.java:98) at java.base/jdk.internal.util.Preconditions.outOfBoundsCheckFromToIndex(Preconditions.java:112) at java.base/jdk.internal.util.Preconditions.checkFromToIndex(Preconditions.java:349) at java.base/java.lang.String.checkBoundsBeginEnd(String.java:4608) at java.base/java.lang.String.substring(String.java:2720) at .(#21:1) . To do a ctrl-F search through a string, we can use the following process: . String str = &quot;He stared out the window at the snowy field. He&#39;d been stuck in the house for close to a month and his only view of the outside world was through the window. There wasn&#39;t much to see. It was mostly just the field with an occasional bird or small animal who ventured into the field. As he continued to stare out the window, he wondered how much longer he&#39;d be shackled to the steel bar inside the house.&quot;; System.out.println(str.indexOf(&quot;animal&quot;)) . 246 . As you can see, the first instance of animal starts at the index of 246. . To compare two strings to each other, we use two functions: . // To check if a string is equal to another string: String str1 = &quot;I am hungry&quot;; String str2 = &quot;I am hungry&quot;; System.out.println(&quot;Does string 1 equal string 2? True or false: &quot; + str1.equals(str2)); String str2 = &quot;I am not hungry&quot;; System.out.println(&quot;Does string 1 equal string 2? True or false: &quot; + str1.equals(str2)); . Does string 1 equal string 2? True or false: true Does string 1 equal string 2? True or false: false . // To compare the lengths of the strings // Case 1: String 1 is shorter than string 2 String str1 = &quot;I am hungry&quot;; String str2 = &quot;I am not hungry&quot;; System.out.println(str1.compareTo(str2)); // Returns less than 0 // Case 2: String 1 is equal string 2 String str1 = &quot;I am hungry&quot;; String str2 = &quot;I am hungry&quot;; System.out.println(str1.compareTo(str2)); // Returns 0 // Case 3: String 1 is longer than string 2 String str1 = &quot;I am hungry&quot;; String str2 = &quot;Hello!&quot;; System.out.println(str1.compareTo(str2)); // Returns greater than 0 . -6 0 1 . compareTo() returns the difference of first unmatched character in the two compared strings. If no unmatch is found, and one string comes out as shorter than other one, then the length difference is returned. It also checks to see if a string comes before or after another string alphabetically. . 2.8 Wrapper Classes: Integer and Double . You probably know what an integer is (if you don’t see me after class immediatley!), and you probably know what a double is (again, if you don’t see me after class immediatley!). . But did you know... Integers and Doubles are classes called wrapper classes! Why would we want to do this? Answer the question in this cell. . Maybe we want to pass a variable as an integer but the program only accepts objects. . Answer These classes convert primitive data types (int/double) to a reference data type (object). We convert these because different data structures in java require different types of variables, some of which are only objects. By parsing the values of the primitive data to an object, we can send values to methods and structures that only take object values, like ArrayList, for example. The integer Wrapper Class . The Integer class in Java is a wrapper class for the primitive data type int. It provides several methods that can be used to perform operations on int values. The constructor looks like this: . Integer(int value) . An example of this running is: . Integer hungerRating = new Integer(5); // Send to an Object int hungerRatingNum = hungerRating.intValue(); // Turn back into a primitive . An example of it being utilized is: . ArrayList&lt;int&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;int&gt;(); // This will cause a compile-time error . | ArrayList&lt;int&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;int&gt;(); // This will cause a compile-time error unexpected type required: reference found: int | ArrayList&lt;int&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;int&gt;(); // This will cause a compile-time error unexpected type required: reference found: int . The above code will not work because ArrayList requires on object type, while we are passing a primitive type. . ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;(); list.add(5); // Autoboxing will automatically convert the int 5 to an Integer object System.out.println(list) . [5] . This code works because the 5 is being converted by the list.add, since the list uses integer objects. . Moreover, we can also get other data from the integer class, which is related to how Java functions. . System.out.println(&quot;Integer Min Value: &quot; + Integer.MIN_VALUE); System.out.println(&quot;Integer Max Value: &quot; + Integer.MAX_VALUE); . Integer Min Value: -2147483648 Integer Max Value: 2147483647 . These numbers are the bounds of integers in java. For example, we can try going outside the range to see what happens. . Integer pleaseBreak = new Integer(2147483648) . | Integer pleaseBreak = new Integer(2147483648); integer number too large . Double Wrapper Classes . Double wrapper classes are basically the same thing as integer classes, however, they deal with double varaiables instead of integer variables. You write it like this: . Double(Double Value) . Here is an example of using Double object: . // My actual height in real life (in feet) Double height = new Double(6.6); // Send to an Object double primitiveHeight = height.doubleValue(); // Turn back into a primitive . And here is an example of when it works and when it does not. . ArrayList&lt;double&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;double&gt;(); // This will cause a compile-time error . | ArrayList&lt;double&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;double&gt;(); // This will cause a compile-time error unexpected type required: reference found: double | ArrayList&lt;double&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;double&gt;(); // This will cause a compile-time error unexpected type required: reference found: double . Again, the ArrayList needs an object type, but we are passing a primitive type. . ArrayList&lt;Double&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;Double&gt;(); list.add(3.14); // Autoboxing will automatically convert the double 3.14 to a Double object . true . This code works because the 3.14 is being converted by the list.add, since the list uses double objects. . Autoboxing . Autoboxing is when Java automatically changes a basic data type into its object form. The Java compiler does this for us. Think of it as putting the data into a box. Java can also unbox an object, which is the exact opposite of autoboxing. When an Integer object is assigned to a primitive int type, Java will automatically use the primitive int version of the number and assign it to the int variable. . // Boxing int a = 5; Integer b = a; . // Unboxing Integer x = new Integer(10); int y = x; . 2.9 Using the Math Class . Java has a built in math class called Math? It is a part of the java.lang class. . System.out.println(Math.abs(-5)) // Absolute Value . 5 . System.out.println(Math.pow(5, 2)) // Power: base, exponent . 25.0 . // Two ways to calculate square roots System.out.println(Math.pow(25, 0.5)); // Allows for different roots System.out.println(Math.sqrt(25)) // Square Root . 5.0 5.0 . Finally, arguably the most important class in math: The random class! Many purposes, especially in game development. What is one purpose? . System.out.println((int)Math.random()) // Always returns zero because the range of math.random is [0, 1) . 0 . In the cell below, experiment and try to figure out a way to call Math.random and impliment bounds, with your bounds being integer bounds of a and b. . // Intended Solution int a = 0; int b = 60; System.out.println((int)((double)Math.random() * (b-a) + a)) . 26 . Hacks! . Note: This is due Monday! Write your hacks in a Jupyter Notebook and then DM them to us over slack by Monday Morning at 8:00 AM. For full credit, all criteria in the hacks must be completed and show some originality. . Hack 1: (0.25) . Create a void method that takes an integer input and adds it to an ArrayList. Then, add a non-void method that is able to call a certain index from the ArrayList. . Hack 2: (0.25) . Create a simple guessing game with random numbers in math, except the random number is taken to a random exponent (also includes roots), and the person has to find out what the root and exponent is (with hints!). Use at least one static and one non-static method in your class. . Hack 3: (0.25) .

            "content": "Java objects . In Java, objects are essentially instances of classes. They represent real-world entities or concepts and contain both data and behaviors, facilitating organized and modular software design. | . Common Types of Java Classes . In Java, classes are the fundamental building blocks of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). They define the structure and behavior of objects, serving as templates or blueprints from which objects are created. Java programs typically consist of multiple classes, each designed to fulfill a specific role. One Java class that you should be familliar with is: . Utility Classes: Utility classes contain static methods that provide common utility functions. These classes are not meant to be instantiated, and they often involve operations such as mathematical calculations, string manipulation, or date formatting. The Math class is an example of a utility class. Java Arrays Class | Java HashMap Class | Java LinkedList Class | . | import java.util.Arrays; public class ArraySortExample { public static void main(String[] args) { int[] numbers = {5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6}; Arrays.sort(numbers); System.out.println(Arrays.toString(numbers)); } } String[] words = {&quot;main&quot;}; ArraySortExample.main(words); . . Java Objects . An object in Java is a basic unit of Object-Oriented Programming and represents real-life entities. Objects are the instances of a class that are created to use the attributes and methods of a class. A typical Java program creates many objects, which as you know, interact by invoking methods. An object consists of : . State: It is represented by attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object. | Behavior: It is represented by the methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object with other objects. | Declaring Objects . When an object of a class is created, the class is said to be instantiated. All the instances share the attributes and the behavior of the class. But the values of those attributes, i.e. the state are unique for each object. A single class may have any number of instances. . As we declare variables like (type name;). This notifies the compiler that we will use the name to refer to data whose type is type. With a primitive variable, this declaration also reserves the proper amount of memory for the variable. So for reference variables , the type must be strictly a concrete class name. In general, we can’t create objects of an abstract class or an interface. . Initializing a Java Object . The new operator instantiates a class by allocating memory for a new object and returning a reference to that memory. The new operator also invokes the class constructor. . public class Dog { public String Name; public int Age; public void Bark(int times) { for (int i = 0; i &lt; times; i++) { System.out.println(&quot;Bark&quot;); } } public static void main(String[] args) { Dog dog = new Dog(); dog.Bark(5); } } Dog.main(words); . Calling a non-void method . It’s possible to call a non-void method on an object so that it returns a value, the type of which is specified with the method. . public class Dog { public String Name; //instance variables public int Age; public Dog(String name, int age) { //construction method Name = name; Age = age; } public String getName() { //non-void method that returns a String return Name; } public static void main(String[] args) { //main code Dog d = new Dog(&quot;Larry&quot;, 4); System.out.println(d.getName()); } } Dog.main(null); . Popcorn Hacks . Modify the code below (the same code as above) to demonstrate one of the following: . An additional Non-void method | Multiple uses of the same Non-void method on different objects | . public class Dog { public String Name; //instance variables public int Age; public Dog(String name, int age) { //construction method Name = name; Age = age; } public String getName() { //non-void method that returns a String return Name; } public static void main(String[] args) { //main code Dog d = new Dog(&quot;Larry&quot;, 4); System.out.println(d.getName()); } } Dog.main(null); . String Objects . String objects are built-in objects in Java that you’re probably pretty familiar with, but it also functions like a class, with the following properties: . String objects can be initialized with the new keyword | Method that acts upon String objects can’t change the String itself, it is inmmutable. | String objects can be concatenated using the + operator, creating a new string that is the combination of the other two strings | Escape sequences can be used to print characters that are otherwise unavailable, using the “&quot; (backslash) symbol &quot; creates a double quote | creates a regular backslash (I actually had to use 4 backslashes for this since markdown also recognizes this combination) | n creates a newline | . | . public class Strings_demo { public static void main(String[] args) { //main code String s1 = &quot;hello&quot;; // The way you are probably used to for string objects String s2 = new String(&quot;hello&quot;); // an alternate method to create the same string variable System.out.println(s1);// these two println statements should print the same thing System.out.println(s2); String s3 = s1+s2; // s3 is a concatenation of s1 and s2 System.out.println(s3); System.out.println(s1); // the method doesn&#39;t actually change the String itself String s4 = new String(&quot;In order to type out a string in Java String, you need 4 &#39;s n You need 3 &#39;s and 1 &quot; to type out a &quot;&quot;); // a demonstration of the escape sequences System.out.println(s4); } } Strings_demo.main(null); .

In Java, Wrapper classes are used to convert between primitive data types (int, boolean) and only store a single value and Reference types (String, ArrayList). It provides a way for us to use primitive datas as objects . Autoboxing and Unboxing . As of Java 5.0, autoboxing and unboxing are added . Autoboxing is the automatic process that Java compiler uses to convert primitive types and their respective Wrapper classes . Unboxing is the opposite, comverting Wrapper classes to primitive types . public class Unboxing_stream { public static void main(String[] args) { //main code int i1 = 10; // primitive data types double d1 = 25.5; Integer I1 = new Integer(i1); // Construction of the Wrapper classes version (superior) Double D1 = new Double(d1); System.out.println(i1); // The values correspond to their original values System.out.println(I1); System.out.println(d1); System.out.println(D1); int i2 = I1.intValue()+5; //usage of the intValue function System.out.println(i2); double d2 = D1.intValue()-1.3; //usage of the doubleValue function System.out.println(d2); System.out.println(Integer.MIN_VALUE); // the actual values of the MIN_VALUE and MAX_VALUE System.out.println(Integer.MAX_VALUE); Integer I2 = i1; // autoboxing bypasses the need for contructor methods Double D2 = d1; System.out.println(I2); System.out.println(D2); int i3 = I2+10; // unboxing without using any methods double d3 = D2-1.3; System.out.println(i3); System.out.println(d3); } } Unboxing_stream.main(null); . the Math class .

Factorial function example: . def factorial(n): if n == 0: return 1 else: return n * factorial(n - 1) n = 5 result = factorial(n) print(f&quot;{n}! = {result}&quot;) . 5! = 120 . Popcorn Hack #2 . Complete the following tasks. Fill in the blank numbers in the segment of a Fibonacci sequence below: . [3, 5, 8, 13, ?, 34, 55, 89, ?] . Write the answer to the following factorials: . 4! = | 6! = 3.4 - Strings . | . What is a string? . Strings are ordered sequences of characters Ex: characters can be numbers, letters, special characters like underscores, or even spaces | . | Substring: a substring can be described as part of an already existing string | String concatenation: joins two or more strings end-to-end to make a new string | Note that each programmming language has its own procedures, methods, or functions for strings We will be covering Python | . | . Let’s look at some of the string examples below. . Below is “len(str)”. This command counts the number of characters in a word (str) and returns that number. For example, for the word “happy” (“len(‘happy’)”), the value returned would be 5. . # len example: string = &quot;Hello, World!&quot; stringLength = len(string) print(f&quot;The string length is {stringLength} characters.&quot;) . The string length is {stringLength} characters. . Below is “concat(str1, str2)”. This returns a single string consisting of “str1” immediately followed by the characters of the second string (“str2”). For example, “concat(‘AP’, ‘class’)” would return “APclass”. . # concat example: string1 = &quot;Hel&quot; string2 = &quot;lo!&quot; # concatenation seen right below result = string1 + string2 print(result) . Hello! . Below is a substring “substring(str1, start, length)”. This returns a substring of consecutive characters from “str1”, starting with the character at position “start” and containing “length” characters. For example, “substring(‘APCSPrinciples’, 3, 6)” would return “CSPrin”. . # substring example: string = &quot;Hello, World!&quot; substring = string[2:10] print(substring) . llo, Wor . Palindromes . The most commonly known definition of a palindrome is represented as being a word or phrase that is spelt the same both forward and backward. . For example, the word “racecar” is a palindrome, because the word is the same whether you read it from left to right or vice versa. . # palindrome example def is_palindrome(s): s = s.lower().replace(&quot; &quot;, &quot;&quot;).replace(&quot;,&quot;, &quot;&quot;).replace(&quot;!&quot;, &quot;&quot;) return s == s[::-1] word = &quot;racecar&quot; print(f&quot;{word} {&#39;is&#39; if is_palindrome(word) else &#39;is not&#39;} a palindrome.&quot;) . racecar is a palindrome. .

Logic Gates in Python: . AND gate, OR gate, NOT gate, NAND gate, NOR gate, XOR gate, and XNOR gate. . What is a logic gate?: Logic gates are used in circuits to make decisions based on a combination of digital signals beign inputed. The concept of logic gates revolves around Boolean algebra as well as binary. It is basically how zero represents the false condition and 1 represents True. Think of it as a switch where if it is at 0, the switch is turned off while if it is 1, then the lightbulb will turn on. . The AND gate requires both inputs to be 1 or true so the end output is true. In other words, the output is 1 only when both inputs one AND two are 1. . . age= 15 if age&gt;2 and type(age)==int: print(age) age=13 if age&gt;2 and type(age)==str: print(age) . De Morgan’s Law . A way to turn statements from AND to OR by negating terms | not (A or B) = (not A) and (not B) | not (A and B) = (not A) or (not B) | . HW Hacks . Use an algorithm to find certain values of the Fibonacci sequence. For example, your code should output the nth index in the sequence. An example of how the sequence works is 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13. The pattern is you add the previous 2 numbers together to get the new number. .",

            "title": "JS Data Abstraction",
            "content": "Variables . A Variable is defined as an abstraction inside of a program that can hold a value. . Variables can be named from letters like X, Y, Z to phrases like APIKEY. The point of these names is to store some sort of Data to a resuable value. . var x = 10; var name = &quot;Gerald&quot;; var fav_food = &quot;Cookies&quot;; . . Variable Naming . This brings us to the topic of naming Variables. The names of variables are really important when working in groups. For example when one of your teammates review your code they use the names of your variables to quickly understand your code. In the code above you can understand that the variable fav_food represents a favorite food . There are 3 Important Coding Practices to follow when it comes to naming variables . SnakeCase . SnakeCase is where you replace spaces in variable names with a underscore . var variable_one = &quot;Aashray&quot;; . Here’s an example of a SnakeCase variable that uses a _ as a space. . Now try making your own SnakeCase variable and set the variable equal to a integer. . PascalCase . PascalCase is where you capitialize every word in your variable, but keep it all as one singluar phrase with no spaces . var VariableOne = &quot;Chrissie&quot;; . Here you can clearly see that the vairable has two diffrent words, and we didn’t need to use a space to seperate it. . Try making your own PascalCase variable . CamelCase . CamelCase is where you captalize the second word in the variable . var variableOne = &quot;Arushi&quot;; . Here the One is captalized to indicate a second word in the variable without using a space. . Try making your own CamelCase . # Attempt to add an integer and a string myInteger = 42 myString = &quot;Hello&quot; # Try to add them together result = myInteger + myString .

Variable Types . Earlier we explained how to assign variables and properly name them. However in the code above even though I followed all these steps and properly named them I ran into a error. This is because the types of data, string and int cannot be added. But what are integers and strings? . In python there are multiple types of data that a variable can be, for now lets look at the most commonly use ones. . Integers . Integers are a numerical value going from 1,2,3,4 or -1,2,-3 etc. These are numbers with no decimals and are ussualy called ints . var x = 3; console.log(x); . In this case we call int x to be 3. Normally you don’t need to say the data type before the variable in python, however in other languages like JS or C++ you would need to. . Strings . Strings are a chain of text, numbers or charcters that are all inside of “ “ . var Cookies = &quot; My Fav cookies are Choclate Chip &quot;; . Here we set a string cookie to be representing the statement that “ My Fav Cookies are Choclate Chip” The “ “ marks are what determine it is a string in most coding languages. . Boolean . Booleans are True or False, and they are used for condtional statements . var ChrissieGetsSleep = false; if (ChrissieGetsSleep === true){ continue; } else{ return 0; } . Here we have a if statement that checks if the boolean variable is currently true and if its true it won’t do anything, but if its false it will return 0. . Float . Floats are a integers that can have decimal values . var x = 3.1415; console.log(x); . In this case we call int x to be 3.1415, and this is a float because of its decimal points. . Arrays . Arrays are ordered collections of items in javascript. They can contain a mix of different data types, including integers, floats, strings, and more. . var my_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; console.log(my_array); . Objects in javascript . Objects are versatile data structures in javascript that store key-value pairs. Each value in an object is associated with a unique key, which allows for efficient lookups and retrieval of values. . var my_obj = { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;age&quot;: 30, &quot;city&quot;: &quot;Wonderland&quot; } console.log(my_obj); . # Concatation of variables int1 = 1 int2 = 2 print(&quot;Concatation between two non strings in a print statement will EVALUATE them.&quot;) print(&quot;Notice how they get ADDED together.&quot;) print(int1 + int2) print() print(&quot;Concatation between two strings in a print statement will CONNECT them.&quot;) print(&quot;Notice how they get CONNECTED together.&quot;) string1 = &quot;1&quot; string2 = &quot;2&quot; print(string1 + string2) # notice how this CONNECTS the variables # Print statements like these can be used to EVALUATE variables (here we add them) # To connect them together (&quot;1&quot; + &quot;2&quot; = &quot;12&quot;), use strings . Concatation between two non strings in a print statement will EVALUATE them. Notice how they get ADDED together. 3 Concatation between two strings in a print statement will CONNECT them. Notice how they get CONNECTED together. 12 . . Choosing the Right Data Type in Python . In Python, choosing the appropriate data type for your variables is essential to ensure efficient and correct program execution. Here’s when to use some common data types: . Integers (int) . Use Cases: Use integers when you need to represent whole numbers without fractional parts. Integers are suitable for counting, indexing, and performing integer arithmetic. | . Floating-Point Numbers (float) . Use Cases: Use floating-point numbers when you need to represent real numbers with decimal points. They are suitable for calculations that involve fractions or decimal values. | . Strings (str) . Use Cases: Use strings when you need to work with text data, such as names, sentences, or any sequence of characters. Strings are versatile and can store both plain text and formatted text. | . Lists (list) . Use Cases: Use lists when you need an ordered collection of items that can be modified. Lists are ideal for storing multiple values of the same or different data types. | . Tuples (tuple) . Use Cases: Use tuples when you need an ordered collection of items that should remain immutable (unchangeable). Tuples are useful for representing fixed sequences of data. | . Dictionaries (dict) . Use Cases: Use dictionaries when you need to store key-value pairs, where each key maps to a specific value. Dictionaries are efficient for looking up values based on keys. | . Sets (set) . Use Cases: Use sets when you need an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are useful for tasks like removing duplicates from a list or performing set operations. | . Booleans (bool) . Use Cases: Use booleans to represent binary values, such as True or False. They are essential for making decisions and controlling the flow of your program using conditional statements. | . None (NoneType) . Use Cases: Use None when you want to represent the absence of a value or indicate that a variable has no assigned value. It’s often used as a placeholder or default initial value. | . Choosing the right data type helps make your code more readable, efficient, and easier to maintain. Understanding the characteristics and limitations of each data type is essential for effective Python programming. . . Represent a list or string using a variable. . # We are going to cover representing lists or strings with a variable. # A list is an ordered sequence of elements. An element is an individual value in a list that is assigned a unique index. # For example, if I have a grocery list with milk, eggs, and cookies, each item is an element. groceryList = [&quot;milk&quot;, &quot;eggs&quot;, &quot;cookies&quot;] # one ^ two ^ three ^ # The index is a method for referencing the elements in the list. For example, if I reference item 1, it will be milk. # IMPORTANT: most if not all programming languages index at 0. This means that the 0th element would be milk and the 1st element is eggs. # For the AP Exam, indexing will be at 1. # Next is a string which is an ordered sequence of characters. # This may contain letters, numbers, and special characters. Examples include: string = &quot;Perry&quot; string2 = &quot;12&quot; string3 = &quot;!@#&quot; stringn4 = &quot;Perry12!@#&quot; . Develop data abstraction using lists to store multiple elements. . # Data abstraction allows for the reduction of a particular body of data to a simplified representation of the whole. # For example, saying that I have a “grocery list” is a lot easier than saying “I have a list with milk, eggs, and cookies.” groceryList = [&quot;milk&quot;, &quot;eggs&quot;, &quot;cookies&quot;] # bundle ^ # In this example, we bundle this data into one term and simplify it. # In programming, you can bundle variables together by type and you can name your bundle (name your list). # With a list, you don’t need to know how many variables will be needed or how the elements will be stored together. # The exam reference sheet will provide notation for lists. . How does data abstraction manage complexity in program code? . # Data abstraction can manage complexity in programs by bundling data together. # This can result in a program that is easier to develop and maintain. # It also allows multiple related items to be treated as a single value. # You also need less variables since one variable holds all the other ones and it allows you to easily modify these variables. groceryList = [&quot;milk&quot;, &quot;eggs&quot;, &quot;cookies&quot;] # nice and short # long and bad item1 = &quot;milk&quot; item2 = &quot;eggs&quot; item3 = &quot;cookies&quot; # modify variables: groceryList = [&quot;milk&quot;, &quot;eggs&quot;, &quot;cookies&quot;] # nice and short print(&quot;Initial List&quot;) print(groceryList) # replace the index 1 with chocolate groceryList[1] = &quot;chocolate&quot; # notice how index 1 is the 2nd element (AP exam index at 1) # add a new element groceryList.append(&quot;flour&quot;) print(&quot;Print List with Flour addeded&quot;) print(groceryList) # remove element groceryList.remove(&quot;milk&quot;) print(&quot;Print List with Milk removed&quot;) print(groceryList) . Initial List [&#39;milk&#39;, &#39;eggs&#39;, &#39;cookies&#39;] Print List with Flour addeded [&#39;milk&#39;, &#39;chocolate&#39;, &#39;cookies&#39;, &#39;flour&#39;] Print List with Milk removed [&#39;chocolate&#39;, &#39;cookies&#39;, &#39;flour&#39;] . . JSON implementation . JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data. It has several uses. For example, if someone is managing an inventory of cars, they can use JSON to import data and export it. . JSON is used when data is sent from a web server to a webpage. . So the car person can use JSON to display their current inventory of cars to sell on their webpage. . Converting from PYTHON TO JSON . import json # you will need to import this library # python dictionary x = { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;John&quot;, &quot;age&quot;: 30, &quot;city&quot;: &quot;New York&quot; } # convert into JSON # we first CALL the library and use the dumps() function # to call the library and use dumps(), we do json.dumps() # note: do you know of function machines in math? where you put in the variable, it does some operations, and outputs it? # a code function is the same! it takes some data, does some code on it, and outputs it! # essentially, we say &quot;Hey! JSON library! I would like to use your dumps() function!&quot; # and then we give the function what we want to dump: &quot;Here is the thing I want to dump into JSON!&quot; # then the library says back &quot;Here you go! Here&#39;s your JSON! I stored it in the y variable!&quot; y = json.dumps(x) print(y) # the result is a JSON string . {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;John&quot;, &quot;age&quot;: 30, &quot;city&quot;: &quot;New York&quot;} .

            "content": "3.1 Variables And Assignments . Variables are considered abstraction as they assign a value to another value. In other words, they basically describe values to each other. Variables are important as it can be used in many different uses such as they can store useful information, especially if you have a long lines of code. Variables are mostly used to store data such as numbers (we are going to go over integers today), booleans, lists, strings and dictionaries. . Note: A variable needs to have a proper name, cannot have spaces inside of them and needs to be reasonable. . For example: . highScore is a better and shorter way of saying highestScoreInTheGame . | firstName is more specific than n . | instead of is raining (because it has spaced) israining or is_it_raining is a better way of looking at the variable . | phonenumber is better than saying 555-number (it just looks neater to look at) . | . firstName = &quot;Nandan&quot; # this is a string print(firstName) highScore = 33 # this is an integer print(highScore) . Nandan 33 . Popcorn Hack#1 - Make your own variable either with a number or a string and print it out . Data Types: . Integer: A whole number . Boolean: True or False based on operators . String: Anything that contains &quot;{text is stored in here}&quot; . ### BOOLEAN EXAMPLES age = 16 # Here is the number example print(bool(age)) print(age&lt;8) PASS_POINTS = 75 FAIL_POINTS = 50 if PASS_POINTS &lt; FAIL_POINTS: passed = True else: passed = False if passed: print(&quot;Student has passed&quot;) else: print(&quot;Student failed&quot;) ## STRING EXAMPLE age = &quot;16&quot; print(age) . True False Student failed 16 . Popcorn Hack #2 - Use the variable types and print all the different types of them, boolean, string, and integer. . 3.1 Variables And Assignments . Assignments and variables are fundamental ideas in computer programming. They give programmers the ability to manage, store, and alter data. In the realm of programming and computer science, knowing how to declare and assign values to variables is an essential ability. . currentName = &quot;Arnav&quot; print(currentName) currentName = &quot;Nandan&quot; # Because this variable is declared second, even though it was already declared, it will print the most recent declaration print(currentName) bigNumber = 10000 isWednesday = True firstName = &quot;Arnav Nadar&quot; print(str(bigNumber) + &quot; &quot; + str(isWednesday) + &quot; &quot; + str(firstName)) . Arnav Nandan . num1 = 25 num2 = 15 num3 = 30 num2 = num3 num3 = num1 num1 = num2 print(num1) print(num2) print(num3) . 30 30 25 . Popcorn Hack #3 - Use the variable types and the variable changing and create a small program that incorporates the changing of variables . 3.2 Data Abstraction - Lists &amp; Strings . Lists and strings are a simple method of data abstraction in which a number of values (list elements or characters) are stored in a single variable. Each value in a list or string can be referred to with its natural-number index. . A string is simply a sequence of characters; letters, numbers, special characters, etc. . A list is an ordered sequence of variables (elements), each of which contains some data value. The elements need not be all the same data type. . #Each element in a list/string is referred to with a natural-number index. #FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE AP EXAM ONLY, the indexes start at 1. #IN PYTHON (and most other languages), the indexes start at 0. #Example string name = &quot;llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch&quot; #Returning the 18th character in the string (&#39;y&#39;) - Remember that Python indices start at 0! print(name[17]) #Example list rn_list = [&quot;Ramskoeldia consimilis&quot;, 187.52, &quot;e&quot;, True, 0, None, &quot;987654&quot;, [1,5,8]] #Returning the 1st, 4th, and 7th elements in the list print(rn_list[0]) print(rn_list[3]) print(rn_list[6]) . y Ramskoeldia consimilis True 987654 . Popcorn Hack #4 - Make your own list based on your intersts and access the items in the list according to your interest . 3.2 Data Abstraction . Data abstraction is the process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to the user. Abstraction can be achieved with either abstract classes or interfaces (which you will learn more about in the next chapter). You can also use the abstract keyword to create abstract methods that must be overridden in the subclass.You do this by putting information in lists, dictionaries, and objects. You can also create your own data types using classes. This is called data abstraction. Here is an example of data abstraction: . def __init__(self, name, age): self.name = name self.age = age def myfunc(self): print(&quot;Hello my name is &quot; + self.name) . This is a class called Person. It takes in two parameters, name and age. It also has a method called myfunc that prints out a message with the name of the person and their age. Lets see this as a list. Lets make a function that takes in a list of people and prints out their names and ages. . def print_people(people): for person in people: print(person.name + &quot; is &quot; + str(person.age) + &quot; years old&quot;) // this will print out the key and the value . This function takes in a list of people and prints out their names and ages. Lets see this as a dictionary. Lets make a function that takes in a dictionary of people and prints out their names and ages. First lets make the dictionary. . people = { &quot;John&quot;: 32, &quot;Rob&quot;: 23, &quot;Amanda&quot;: 19 } . Then we can make the function. . people = { &quot;John&quot;: 32, &quot;Rob&quot;: 23, &quot;Amanda&quot;: 19 } // this is the dictionary def print_people(people): // this is the function for person in people: // this is the for loop print(person + &quot; is &quot; + str(people[person]) + &quot; years old&quot;) // this will print out the key and the value . Converting string to and from JSON . First we need to import the json module. Then we can use the json.dumps() function to convert a string to JSON. We can also use the json.loads() function to convert JSON to a string. Here is an example of converting a string to JSON: . import json dict = &#39;{&quot;name&quot;: &quot;John&quot;, &quot;age&quot;: 30, &quot;city&quot;: &quot;New York&quot;}&#39; json_obj = json.dumps(dict) print(json_obj) . Hacks . You can use the type() function to find out what type of data type a variable is as shown below: x = 5 print(type(x)) . | You can use the isinstance() function to check if a variable is a certain data type as shown below: x = 5 print(isinstance(x, int)) . | You can use the dir() function to find out what methods an object has as shown below: x = 5 print(dir(x)) . | . Homework . Create a class called Person with the attributes name and age. Then create a function called print_people that takes in a list of people and prints out their names and ages. | Create a function that takes in a dictionary of people and their ages and prints out the name of the oldest person. | . JSON . JSON is used to represent structured data, especially lists in JavaScript. However you can also use this in python as well. . Converting string to and from JSON . First we need to import the json module. Then we can use the json.dumps() function to convert a string to JSON. We can also use the json.loads() function to convert JSON to a string. Here is an example of converting a string to JSON: . import json list = [&quot;Torin&quot;, &quot;Remy&quot;, &quot;Nandan&quot;, &quot;Arnav&quot;] json_obj = json.dumps(list) print(json_obj) . [&quot;Torin&quot;, &quot;Remy&quot;, &quot;Nandan&quot;, &quot;Arnav&quot;] . Popcorn Hack #5 - Try using some of the lists in order to assign it to variables many times. Do JSON with a different list as well. . Hack 1 . Identify the correct variable types for each of the practice problems . String | Boolean | Integer | List | . secretNumber = 15 print(secretNumber) food = &quot;Pizza&quot; print(food) names = [&quot;Nandan&quot;, &quot;Arnav&quot;, &quot;Torin&quot;, &quot;Remy&quot;] print(names) IamCool = True print(IamCool) ##Bonus Problem: names_2 = { &quot;Nandan&quot;: &quot;TeamMate1&quot;, &quot;Arnav&quot;: &quot;TeamMate2&quot;, &quot;Torin&quot;: &quot;TeamMate3&quot;, &quot;Remy&quot;: &quot;TeamMate4&quot;, } print(names_2) . 15 Pizza [&#39;Nandan&#39;, &#39;Arnav&#39;, &#39;Torin&#39;, &#39;Remy&#39;] True {&#39;Nandan&#39;: &#39;TeamMate1&#39;, &#39;Arnav&#39;: &#39;TeamMate2&#39;, &#39;Torin&#39;: &#39;TeamMate3&#39;, &#39;Remy&#39;: &#39;TeamMate4&#39;} . Hack 2 . Create a program of interest using the variable types, lists, and assignment operators that have been discussed in the lesson. This could be anything, use what you learned and are interested in to create a small program showcasing what you’ve learnt so far. .",

            "content": "Variables . A Variable is defined as an abstraction inside of a program that can hold a value. . Variables can be named from letters like X, Y, Z to phrases like APIKEY. The point of these names is to store some sort of Data to a resuable value. . x = 10 name = &quot;Gerald&quot; fav_food = &quot;Cookies&quot; . . Variable Naming . This brings us to the topic of naming Variables. The names of variables are really important when working in groups. For example when one of your teammates review your code they use the names of your variables to quickly understand your code. In the code above you can understand that the variable fav_food represents a favorite food . There are 3 Important Coding Practices to follow when it comes to naming variables . SnakeCase . SnakeCase is where you replace spaces in variable names with a underscore . variable_one = &quot;Aashray&quot; . Here’s an example of a SnakeCase variable that uses a _ as a space. . Now try making your own SnakeCase variable and set the variable equal to a integer. . PascalCase . PascalCase is where you capitialize every word in your variable, but keep it all as one singluar phrase with no spaces . VariableOne = &quot;Chrissie&quot; . Here you can clearly see that the vairable has two diffrent words, and we didn’t need to use a space to seperate it. . Try making your own PascalCase variable . CamelCase . CamelCase is where you captalize the second word in the variable . variableOne = &quot;Arushi&quot; . Here the One is captalized to indicate a second word in the variable without using a space. . Try making your own CamelCase . # Attempt to add an integer and a string myInteger = 42 myString = &quot;Hello&quot; # Try to add them together result = myInteger + myString .

Variable Types . Earlier we explained how to assign variables and properly name them. However in the code above even though I followed all these steps and properly named them I ran into a error. This is because the types of data, string and int cannot be added. But what are integers and strings? . In python there are multiple types of data that a variable can be, for now lets look at the most commonly use ones. . Integers . Integers are a numerical value going from 1,2,3,4 or -1,2,-3 etc. These are numbers with no decimals and are ussualy called ints . int x = 3 print(x) . In this case we call int x to be 3. Normally you don’t need to say the data type before the variable in python, however in other languages like JS or C++ you would need to. . Strings . Strings are a chain of text, numbers or charcters that are all inside of “ “ . str Cookies = &quot; My Fav cookies are Choclate Chip &quot; . Here we set a string cookie to be representing the statement that “ My Fav Cookies are Choclate Chip” The “ “ marks are what determine it is a string in most coding languages. . Boolean . Booleans are True or False, and they are used for condtional statements . ChrissieGetsSleep = False if ChrissieGetsSleep = True: pass else: return 0 . Here we have a if statement that checks if the boolean variable is currently true and if its true it won’t do anything, but if its false it will return 0. . Float . Floats are a integers that can have decimal values . x = 3.1415 print(x) . In this case we call int x to be 3.1415, and this is a float because of its decimal points. . Lists . Lists are ordered collections of items in Python. They can contain a mix of different data types, including integers, floats, strings, and more. . my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] print(my_list) . Dictionaries in Python . Dictionaries are versatile data structures in Python that store key-value pairs. Each value in a dictionary is associated with a unique key, which allows for efficient lookups and retrieval of values. . my_dict = { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;age&quot;: 30, &quot;city&quot;: &quot;Wonderland&quot; } print(my_dict) . # Concatation of variables int1 = 1 int2 = 2 print(&quot;Concatation between two non strings in a print statement will EVALUATE them.&quot;) print(&quot;Notice how they get ADDED together.&quot;) print(int1 + int2) print() print(&quot;Concatation between two strings in a print statement will CONNECT them.&quot;) print(&quot;Notice how they get CONNECTED together.&quot;) string1 = &quot;1&quot; string2 = &quot;2&quot; print(string1 + string2) # notice how this CONNECTS the variables # Print statements like these can be used to EVALUATE variables (here we add them) # To connect them together (&quot;1&quot; + &quot;2&quot; = &quot;12&quot;), use strings . Concatation between two non strings in a print statement will EVALUATE them. Notice how they get ADDED together. 3 Concatation between two strings in a print statement will CONNECT them. Notice how they get CONNECTED together. 12 . . Choosing the Right Data Type in Python . In Python, choosing the appropriate data type for your variables is essential to ensure efficient and correct program execution. Here’s when to use some common data types: . Integers (int) . Use Cases: Use integers when you need to represent whole numbers without fractional parts. Integers are suitable for counting, indexing, and performing integer arithmetic. | . Floating-Point Numbers (float) . Use Cases: Use floating-point numbers when you need to represent real numbers with decimal points. They are suitable for calculations that involve fractions or decimal values. | . Strings (str) . Use Cases: Use strings when you need to work with text data, such as names, sentences, or any sequence of characters. Strings are versatile and can store both plain text and formatted text. | . Lists (list) . Use Cases: Use lists when you need an ordered collection of items that can be modified. Lists are ideal for storing multiple values of the same or different data types. | . Tuples (tuple) . Use Cases: Use tuples when you need an ordered collection of items that should remain immutable (unchangeable). Tuples are useful for representing fixed sequences of data. | . Dictionaries (dict) . Use Cases: Use dictionaries when you need to store key-value pairs, where each key maps to a specific value. Dictionaries are efficient for looking up values based on keys. | . Sets (set) . Use Cases: Use sets when you need an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are useful for tasks like removing duplicates from a list or performing set operations. | . Booleans (bool) . Use Cases: Use booleans to represent binary values, such as True or False. They are essential for making decisions and controlling the flow of your program using conditional statements. | . None (NoneType) . Use Cases: Use None when you want to represent the absence of a value or indicate that a variable has no assigned value. It’s often used as a placeholder or default initial value. | . Choosing the right data type helps make your code more readable, efficient, and easier to maintain. Understanding the characteristics and limitations of each data type is essential for effective Python programming. . . Represent a list or string using a variable. . # We are going to cover representing lists or strings with a variable. # A list is an ordered sequence of elements. An element is an individual value in a list that is assigned a unique index. # For example, if I have a grocery list with milk, eggs, and cookies, each item is an element. groceryList = [&quot;milk&quot;, &quot;eggs&quot;, &quot;cookies&quot;] # one ^ two ^ three ^ # The index is a method for referencing the elements in the list. For example, if I reference item 1, it will be milk. # IMPORTANT: most if not all programming languages index at 0. This means that the 0th element would be milk and the 1st element is eggs. # For the AP Exam, indexing will be at 1. # Next is a string which is an ordered sequence of characters. # This may contain letters, numbers, and special characters. Examples include: string = &quot;Perry&quot; string2 = &quot;12&quot; string3 = &quot;!@#&quot; stringn4 = &quot;Perry12!@#&quot; . Develop data abstraction using lists to store multiple elements. . # Data abstraction allows for the reduction of a particular body of data to a simplified representation of the whole. # For example, saying that I have a “grocery list” is a lot easier than saying “I have a list with milk, eggs, and cookies.” groceryList = [&quot;milk&quot;, &quot;eggs&quot;, &quot;cookies&quot;] # bundle ^ # In this example, we bundle this data into one term and simplify it. # In programming, you can bundle variables together by type and you can name your bundle (name your list). # With a list, you don’t need to know how many variables will be needed or how the elements will be stored together. # The exam reference sheet will provide notation for lists. . How does data abstraction manage complexity in program code? . # Data abstraction can manage complexity in programs by bundling data together. # This can result in a program that is easier to develop and maintain. # It also allows multiple related items to be treated as a single value. # You also need less variables since one variable holds all the other ones and it allows you to easily modify these variables. groceryList = [&quot;milk&quot;, &quot;eggs&quot;, &quot;cookies&quot;] # nice and short # long and bad item1 = &quot;milk&quot; item2 = &quot;eggs&quot; item3 = &quot;cookies&quot; # modify variables: groceryList = [&quot;milk&quot;, &quot;eggs&quot;, &quot;cookies&quot;] # nice and short print(&quot;Initial List&quot;) print(groceryList) # replace the index 1 with chocolate groceryList[1] = &quot;chocolate&quot; # notice how index 1 is the 2nd element (AP exam index at 1) # add a new element groceryList.append(&quot;flour&quot;) print(&quot;Print List with Flour addeded&quot;) print(groceryList) # remove element groceryList.remove(&quot;milk&quot;) print(&quot;Print List with Milk removed&quot;) print(groceryList) . Initial List [&#39;milk&#39;, &#39;eggs&#39;, &#39;cookies&#39;] Print List with Flour addeded [&#39;milk&#39;, &#39;chocolate&#39;, &#39;cookies&#39;, &#39;flour&#39;] Print List with Milk removed [&#39;chocolate&#39;, &#39;cookies&#39;, &#39;flour&#39;] . . JSON implementation . JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data. It has several uses. For example, if someone is managing an inventory of cars, they can use JSON to import data and export it. . JSON is used when data is sent from a web server to a webpage. . So the car person can use JSON to display their current inventory of cars to sell on their webpage. . Converting from PYTHON TO JSON . import json # you will need to import this library # python dictionary x = { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;John&quot;, &quot;age&quot;: 30, &quot;city&quot;: &quot;New York&quot; } # convert into JSON # we first CALL the library and use the dumps() function # to call the library and use dumps(), we do json.dumps() # note: do you know of function machines in math? where you put in the variable, it does some operations, and outputs it? # a code function is the same! it takes some data, does some code on it, and outputs it! # essentially, we say &quot;Hey! JSON library! I would like to use your dumps() function!&quot; # and then we give the function what we want to dump: &quot;Here is the thing I want to dump into JSON!&quot; # then the library says back &quot;Here you go! Here&#39;s your JSON! I stored it in the y variable!&quot; y = json.dumps(x) print(y) # the result is a JSON string . {&quot;name&quot;: &quot;John&quot;, &quot;age&quot;: 30, &quot;city&quot;: &quot;New York&quot;} . Formatting . # the result above isn&#39;t easy to read. let&#39;s fix that by formatting! import json x = { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;John&quot;, &quot;age&quot;: 30, &quot;city&quot;: &quot;New York&quot; } print(&quot;Indent&quot;) y = json.dumps(x, indent=4) # we call the function but say &quot;Please indent it for me!&quot; print(y + &quot; n&quot;) # the &quot; n&quot; is a newline seperator and adds a space between each print statement print(&quot;Indent + seperator&quot;) y = json.dumps(x, indent=4, separators=(&quot;.&quot;, &quot; = &quot;)) # we change the seperator print(y + &quot; n&quot;) print(&quot;Indent + seperator + sorted&quot;) y = json.dumps(x, indent=4, separators=(&quot;.&quot;, &quot; = &quot;), sort_keys=True) # now we are sorting them print(y) . Indent { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;John&quot;, &quot;age&quot;: 30, &quot;city&quot;: &quot;New York&quot; } Indent + seperator { &quot;name&quot; = &quot;John&quot;. &quot;age&quot; = 30. &quot;city&quot; = &quot;New York&quot; } Indent + seperator + sorted { &quot;age&quot; = 30. &quot;city&quot; = &quot;New York&quot;. &quot;name&quot; = &quot;John&quot; } . Converting from PYTHON TO JSON . import json x = &#39;{ &quot;name&quot;:&quot;John&quot;, &quot;age&quot;:30, &quot;city&quot;:&quot;New York&quot;}&#39; # some JSON y = json.loads(x) # parse with loads() function print(y[&quot;age&quot;]) # the result is a Python dictionary . 30 .

Why does java matter? . one of the main reason that java is such an important language in the coding world is because it is a object-oriented-programming (OOP) language. . It offers a structure that is easy to solve big problems, nut I think that we all know that, so let’s skip to the real deal. . Basics of Java . Block Comments- The compiler will ignore any text between /* and */ . | Line comments- Same as above but // ignores one line . | Class Declaration - identifies the name, the start and the end of the class. the class name must match the file name. (case sensitive) . | main Method- controls all of the action in the program. . | System.out- methods that print output to the console . | System.out.print- prints what ever you out inside the () . | System.out.println- prints out input to the output and adds a newline to the end of it . | . tip: add “&lt;classname&gt;.main(null)” at the end of your code to see the output in your jupyter notebook. . /* this is a code block */ // code: printing out hello world. public class greeting { public static void main (String [] args) { System.out.println(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); System.out.print(&quot;Hello,&quot;); System.out.print(&quot; World!&quot;); } } greeting.main(null) . What is a string literal? . any sequence of letters, numbers, or symbols that is put between quotes. | Java will put out anything in the quotes, no restrictions. | If you would like to include a quote character in your literal, you must escape it with a backslash (e.g. &quot; &quot;&quot; would print &quot;) | . Examples: . public class stingLiterals { public static void main (String[] args) { System.out.println(&quot;This is a string literal.&quot;); System.out.println(&quot;and so are these&quot;); System.out.println(&quot;1234567890&quot;); System.out.println(&quot;&amp;^&amp;*%^$&amp;%$#^%W#*^$%&amp;(*^)&quot;); System.out.println(&quot;Escaped quotation mark: &quot;Hello! &quot;&quot;) } } stingLiterals.main(null) .

Compound Assignment Operators . look at storing items in variables with assignment statemt. . also look at compound assignment operators (+=, -= etc) to modify values stored in variables in one step . += adds value to existing variable value . x += 7 is equivalent to x = x + 7; x -= 5 is equivalent to x = x - 5; . same for all compound assignment operators. . also learn how to trace through code (check comments of codeblock below) . public class CompoundDemo { public static void main(String[] args) { int x = 6; x += 7; // 6 + 7 = 13 x -= 3; // 13 - 3 = 10 System.out.println(x); x *= 10; // 10 * 10 x /= 5; // 100 / 5 = 20 System.out.println(x); x %= 3; // remainder of 100/3 = 2 System.out.println(x); } } CompoundDemo.main(null); // NOTE: going through these compound assignments with comments is called tracing, // when we do what the compiler does, and go through the code step by step. Should be //done on the AP test to avoid human error. . increment and decrement operator . IMPORTANT: THE USE OF INCREMENT AND DECREMENT OPERATORS IN THE PREFIX FORM (++X) AND INSIDE OTHER EXPRESSIONS (ARR[X++]) IS OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THE COURSE AND THE AP EXAM . public class incdecDemo { public static void main(String[] args) { int x = 1; int y = 1; x++; // x = x + 1, x = 2; y--; // y = y - 1, y = 1 - 1 = 1; System.out.println(x); System.out.println(y); } } incdecDemo.main(null); // NOTE: going through these compound assignments in order is important to // ensure you get the correct output at the end . learn how to describe code . the following code segment has comments that describe the line of code the comment is on. Look at how the code is described. . public class behaviorDemo { public static void main(String[] args) { int x = 20; // define an int variable x and set its initial value to 23 x *= 2; // take the current value of x, multiply it by 2, assign the result back to x x %= 10; // take the current value of x, find x modulus 10 (remainder x divided by 10), //assign result back to x System.out.println(x); // display the current value of x } } behaviorDemoDemo.main(null); . practice important concepts . public class numbers { public static void main(String[] args) { int x = 777; // challenge: use 2 compound assignment operators to turn the current value of x // into the value in the comment. print it at each step. for example, to change // the value to 1400: // x -= 77; // x *= 2; // 100? // 779? // 2? System.out.println(x); } } CompoundDemo.main(null); . // PRACTICE TRACING THROUGH THE FOLLOWING CODE (someone could come up and do it on a whiteboard if we have time for fun) // comment the value of x after each statement public class Demo { public static void main(String[] args) { int x = 758; // x = 758 x += 423; // x = ... x -= 137; x *= 99; x /= 33; x %= 111; System.out.println(x); } } CompoundDemo.main(null); . // DESCRIBE EACH LINE OF CODE in a comment after each statement int x = 5; x++; x /= 2; System.out.println(x); . what you must know . compound operators perform an operation on a variable and assign the result to the variable . ex: x /= 25; would take x and divide it by 25, then assign the result to x. . if x = 100, then the result of x/= 25; would be x=4. . increment and decrement operators take x and either increment it or decrement it by 1, then assign the value to x. . x++; would take x and add 1 to it, then assign the value to x. . x–; takes x and subtracts 1 from x, then assigns the value to x. . your frq will likely see if you know how to use compound operators in actual code. . mini hacks: . write some java code that uses compound operators and then trace through it similarly to the examples shown in this lesson. Use conditional statements as well, don’t just execute some compound operators on an x value in order and call it a day. You might have to do tracing on the AP test so this is for your own good. | example below . public class CompoundAssignment { public static void main(String[] args) { int sum = 0; for (int i = 0; i &lt; 2; i++) { // i = i + 1 each iteration, 1st iteration i = 0 for (int j = 0; j &lt; 2; j++) { // j = j + 1 each iteration, 1st iteration j = 0 System.out.println(&quot;i: &quot; + i); System.out.println(&quot;j: &quot; + j); sum += i + j; // sum = sum + (i + j) each iteration, 1st iteration sum = 0 + (0 + 0) System.out.println(sum); } } System.out.println(&quot;Sum: &quot; + sum); } } CompoundAssignment.main(null); . 1.5 . . . Casting Variable . CASTING . &quot;Change the data type of variable from one type to another.&quot; . Example . Int variable —-» double | String variable —-» Int | . /* * Purpose: Demonstrate casting using division. */ public class CastingNumbers { public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(6 / 4); // if I just do divide 6 by 4, these are both int value, so I&#39;m going to wing up with an int result. System.out.println (6.0 / 4); // Since one of those value is a double value, output will be double System.out.println(6 / 4.0); // (Same Reason) I wind up with the result of 1.5 } } . What will be the answer of System.out.println((double) 6/4); By using the casting operator of double in parentheses, it will still wind up with a double result of 1.5. | . | .

Essential Knowledge (2.B) . The casting operators (int) and (double) can be used to created temporary value converted into a different data type. | Casting a double value to an int causes the digits to the right of the decimal point to be truncated. | Some programming code causes int values to be automatically cast(widened) to double values. | Value of type double can be rounded to the nearest integer (int) (x + 0.5) + (int) (x - 0.5) for negative numbers. | Essential Knowledge (5.B) . Integer values in Java are represented by values of type int, which are stored using a finite amount (4 bytes) of memory. Therefore, an int value must be in the range from Integer.MIN_VALUE to Integer.MAX_VALUE inclusive. | If an expression would evaluate to an int value outside of the allowed range, an integer overflow occurs.

            "content": "Java is used around the world to create applications and is one of the most popular coding languages. The reason Java is so popular is because of it’s security and versatility provided by it’s Object Oriented nature. . 1.1 Basics . public class Main { int x = 5; public static void main(String[] args) { Main myObj = new Main(); System.out.println(myObj.x); } } . 1.2 Variables and Data Types . Variables . A Variable is a name given to a memory location that is holding the specified value. Here are some naming practices: . Use camel case. likeThis. | Don’t start with a number. | Spaces are not allowed. | No reserved characters, like $, @, and &amp; | . Java is a strongly typed language so you always need to declare the type of the variable. Variables can also be declared on their own or in the same line as when they are given a value: . int primitive5; // primitive5 = 1 // python comparison //Or... int primitive6 = 1; . What are the greatest values integers and doubles can store? . Primitive Data . Primitive data determines the size and type of information. Primitive types are the most simple type of variable. They are simply store a short amount of raw data, and are not associated with another class. . Here are the different primitive types: . byte: An 8-bit signed two’s complement integer. | short: A 16-bit signed two’s complement integer. | int: A 32-bit signed two’s complement integer. | long: A 64-bit signed two’s complement integer. | float: A single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point. | double: A double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point. | boolean: Stores either true or false. | char: Stores a single character. | . For this class you need to know: . int primitive1 = 0; //Whole number double primitive2 = 1.1; //Decimal values. Floating point numbers. boolean primitive3 = true; //Stores a true of false binary value char primitive4 = &#39;a&#39;; //Single character . Data Type Size (bits) . boolean | 8 | . int | 32 | . double | 64 | . char | 16 | . public class GreatestValue { public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(&quot;Max Integer: &quot; + Integer.MAX_VALUE); System.out.println(&quot;Min Integer: &quot; + Integer.MIN_VALUE); System.out.println(&quot;Max Double: &quot; + Double.MAX_VALUE); System.out.println(&quot;Min Double: &quot; + Double.MIN_VALUE); // Integer Show Overflow int i = Integer.MAX_VALUE; i++; System.out.println(&quot;Integer Max + 1, Overflow: &quot; + i); // Integer Show Underflow int j = Integer.MIN_VALUE; j--; System.out.println(&quot;Integer Min - 1, Underflow: &quot; + j); // Integer Max + Min int k = Integer.MAX_VALUE + Integer.MIN_VALUE; System.out.println(&quot;Integer Max + Min: &quot; + k); } } GreatestValue.main(null); . Max Integer: 2147483647 Min Integer: -2147483648 Max Double: 1.7976931348623157E308 Min Double: 4.9E-324 Integer Max + 1, Overflow: -2147483648 Integer Min - 1, Underflow: 2147483647 Integer Max + Min: -1 . Reference Types . Some data types, like String, start with a capital letter. This is because they are not primiative, but are refrence types. They are called this because they refrence an object. . “A reference type is a code object that is not stored directly where it is created, but that acts as a kind of pointer to a value stored elsewhere.” . int integer = 7120; //&quot;int&quot; starts with a lowercase String string = &quot;abc&quot;; //&quot;String&quot; starts with an uppercase, because it is an object and not a primitive type . All Reference Types Reference Objects: String Example . String is the most common reference type. Here is an example of how a String type is really just referencing an object. . public class WorseString { private char[] charArray; public WorseString(String inputString) { this.charArray = inputString.toCharArray(); } public String getChars() { return new String(this.charArray); } @Override public String toString() { return getChars(); } } . WorseString string = new WorseString(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); System.out.println(string); . Hello, World! . Therefore, these two things are the same: . String string = &quot;abc&quot;; String string = new String(&quot;abc&quot;); . Literal vs String literal . Literal: Source code representation of a fixed value — 3 | String Literal: In double quotes, a String — “3” | . 1.3 Expressions and Assignment Statements . Calculations and evaluating arithmetic statements is important when coding to create algorithms and other code. Make sure you are doing arithmetic statements with int or double values and not String literals . Operators . Operator Example Equation Output Use . + | 5 + 3 | 8 | Add numbers together. | . - | 5 - 3 | 2 | Subtract one number from another. | . * | 5 * 3 | 15 | Multiply numbers together. | . / | 5 / 3.0 | 1.67 | Divide one number by double. | . / | 5 / 3 | 1 | Divide one number by int. | . % | 5 % 3 | 2 | Find the remainder of a division operation. | . Tip: In the AP subset, you only have to worry about operations with int values. However, it’s good to know how to use arithmetic statements with doubles and other types. . If you do an operation with two ints or doubles, it returns the respective type. If you mix types, Java returns the one with more bits, a double in this case. . Modulus . Modulus gets the remainder if you were to divide two numbers. One common use is to find odd/even numbers. . 5 % 2 = 1 | 100 % 10 = 0 | . You try: . 8 % 3 = ? | 4 % 1 = ? | . Modulus joins multiplication and division in the order of operations . Assignment Operator . = is called the assignment operator because it is used to assign a value to a variable. It is the last in the order of operations. . Casting . Casting is converting one type of variable to another ex: double to int . public class Casting { public static void main(String[] args) { double castTest = 3.2; System.out.println((int) castTest); castTest = 3.7; System.out.println((int) castTest); System.out.println((int) (castTest+0.5)); int castTest2 = 3; System.out.println(castTest2/2); System.out.println(castTest2/2.0); } } Casting.main(null); . 3 3 4 1 1.5 . What will this output? castTest2 = 7; System.out.println(castTest2/3); System.out.println((int) (castTest2+0.5)); . Wrapper Classes . For many operations in Java, you need to have a class. Some examples are: . ArrayLists or HashMaps | If you require nullability (meaning the value could be null) | Generics | Methods that require objects as input | . To accomplish this, we use a wrapper class. A wrapper class is essentially a class which ‘wraps’ the primitive type and makes it into an object rather than a primitive. . What is a downside of using wrapper classes? Why not always use them? . Increased memory usage //This code fails ArrayList ArrayList = new ArrayList&lt;int&gt;(); . | ArrayList ArrayList = new ArrayList&lt;int&gt;(); unexpected type required: reference found: int . //This code works ArrayList ArrayList = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;(); . . public class Wrappers { int age; Integer ageWrapper; Double gpa; String gpaString; Double gpaDouble; public static void main(String[] args) { // make an instance of class Wrappers wrapper = new Wrappers(); // work with int and Integer wrapper.ageWrapper = 17; wrapper.age = Integer.parseInt(wrapper.ageWrapper.toString()); System.out.println(&quot;Age &quot; + wrapper.age); System.out.println(&quot;Age Wrapper &quot; + wrapper.ageWrapper); // work with String and Double wrapper.gpaString = &quot;3.9&quot;; System.out.println(&quot;Wrapper GPA &quot; + wrapper.gpaString); // string to double with calculation wrapper.gpaDouble = (Double.parseDouble(wrapper.gpaString) + 3.7) / 2; System.out.println(&quot;Double GPA &quot; + wrapper.gpaDouble); wrapper.gpa = Double.parseDouble(wrapper.gpaDouble.toString()); System.out.println(&quot;GPA &quot; + wrapper.gpa); } } Wrappers.main(null); .

            "content": "- CB 3.12,3.13 Developing Procedures . What is a procedure? . A procedure is a named group of code that has paramaters and return values. Procedures are known as methods or functions depending on the language. . A procedure executes the statements within it on the parameters to provide a return value. . What are parameters? . Paramaters are input values of a procedure that are specified by arguments.Arguments specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called. . By creating theses algorithms the readibility of code increases and the complexity decreases. This is becasue a function’s name can tell the reader what action it will perform, and by calling it, the code becomes more clean and easy to understand. . What is a return value? . A return value is the value that is returned when a function or a method is called. . That return value can be assigned or printed . . Procedures are used to create algorthims that can perform certain actions or return values. When a procedure returns a value, theis information must be stored in a variable for later use. However some procedures like the MOVE_FORWARD() perform an action, and don’t return a value. The image above provides an example of where procedures that don’t output a value would be used. . A 60$ item recieves a 20% discount and taxed at 8%. PROCEDURE applyDiscount(cost, percentDiscounted) { temp ← 100 - percentDiscounted temp← temp/ 100 cost ← cost *temp RETURN(cost) } price ← applyDiscount(60, 20) This is how we get the final price with the discount by calling the procedure and assigning it to the price variable. PROCEDURE applyTax(cost, percentTaxed) { temp ← 100 + percentTaxed temp← temp/ 100 cost ← cost *temp RETURN(cost) } price ← applyTax(price, 8) This applys the 8% tax to the price determined after the discount. . Popcorn Hack 1 . Given the applyTax procedure above: How would you call the procedure to get it to find the price using cost = 50, and percentTaxed = 10, and what value will it return? . #code here . What Are Functions? . Collections of code | Divides large program into smaller chunks | Better readability | Less repetitive code | More efficient code | Good organization | . What Are The Components of a Function? . The function declaration | The parameters (input). This is also referred to as an argument when a value is being passed to the actual function. | The functionality | The return value (output) | Calling the function | . # Defining Functions # # def function_name(parameter1, parameter2, etc..): # code here... # # return return_value; # return the value of parameter1 plus parameter2; def add(parameter1, parameter2): # creates a function that takes in two parameters solution = parameter1 + parameter2; # sets solution to the sum of parameter1 and parameter2 return solution; # return solution print(add(5, 5)); # prints the return value of add(5,5) .

            "content": "3.1 Variables and Assignments . Variables . What is a variable? . An abstraction inside a program that can hold value/store information | Note: a variable should be concise but not too short (i.e. one letter), and it shouldn’t have spaces or any special characters Ex: “highScore” is more concise than “highestscoreinthegame” | Ex: “name” is more specific than “n” | Ex: “isitraining” doesn’t have spaces in between the words | Ex: “phonenumber” doesn’t have a hyphen like “555-number” | . | . Examples . numStudents = 26 print(numStudents) car = &quot;Tesla&quot; print(car) . 26 Tesla . Popcorn Hack 1 . Define your own variable and print it in a separate code cell using Python. Make it relate to one of your hobbies or interests. Data Types . A data type is a type of variable, and these are 3 of the 4 main types: . integer: a mathematical number | boolean: a yes/no or true/false statement | text (or string): for any text-based variable (including phone numbers) | . Examples . Note that for Python you need to classify anything other than a string as a string (or “str”) in order to print | the following examples represent the storing of data within a variable | . highScore = 9 isRaining = False firstName = &quot;Nikki&quot; print(str(highScore) + &quot; is an integer&quot;) print(str(isRaining) + &quot; is a boolean&quot;) print(firstName + &quot; is a string&quot;) . 9 is an integer False is a boolean Nikki is a string . Popcorn Hack 2 . Define a string, boolean, and integer. Print all 3 together like so. Changing Values . A variable itself isn’t static, so you can change it to give different or more updated information. An example of this is having a variable that calculates changing age. . Examples . The following examples shows how you can replace one variable with another. See if you can figure out what data will be printed out before it runs! . currentScore = 10 highScore = currentScore currentScore = 7 print(str(highScore)) . 10 . num1 = 25 num2 = 15 num3 = 30 num2 = num3 num3 = num1 num1 = num2 print(str(num1)) print(str(num2)) print(str(num3)) . 30 30 25 . Popcorn Hack 3 . Write a program to equate the value of a first variable to a second variable. Print the second variable, and you should see the same content as the first variable. 3.2 Data Abstraction . New Types of Variables . Strings an ordered sequence of characters | may contain letters, numbers, and all other special characters | Ex: words, phrases, sentences, ID numbers | . | Lists an ordered sequence of elements | each element is a variable | Ex: playlist of songs, names of students in a class, contacts in your phone | . | . List Index . Each element of a string is referenced by an index | For the AP test an index will start at 1 (example image below), but in actuality it starts at 0 (the following examples) | . . Examples . groupNames = [&quot;Nikki&quot;, &quot;Ankit&quot;, &quot;Varun&quot;, &quot;Monika&quot;] print(groupNames[0]) print(groupNames[1]) print(groupNames[2]) print(groupNames[3]) . Nikki Ankit Varun Monika . Popcorn Hack 4 . Create a list with your current schedule of classes. Print only the 2nd class in your schedule. Data Abstraction - Lists . lists allow for data abstraction bundle variables together strings, numbers, characters, etc. | . | give one name to a set of memory cells do not need to know how many variables will be needed | . | do not need to know how the elements are stored together | . | . Examples . The following example showcases the concept of changing values but with lists instead. . scores1 = [89, 72, 34, 56, 83] scores2 = [23, 25, 96, 55] scores1 = scores2 print(str(scores1)) . [23, 25, 96, 55] . How Lists Manage Complexity of a Program . May not need as many variables (improves readability) Ex: variable for each student is more tedious than one variable that holds all students | . | Change the number of variables Ex: if a student transfers in/out of school, you won’t need to add/delete an entire variable (you’re just deleting one element from a list) | . | Consistent computations Ex: a list of test scores can be curved with the same calculation for all scores (you can do it to everything all at once) | . | . Examples . The following example showcases the convenience a list offers. The first series of scores would require more time to print out versus the second version (in list form). We would be able to curve the scores of a class all at once more easily using the second version. . score1 = 23 score2 = 35 score3 = 25 score4 = 44 score5 = 56 score6 = 78 score7 = 62 score8 = 92 score9 = 94 score10 = 47 scores = [23, 35, 25, 44, 56, 78, 62, 92, 94, 47] print(str(scores)) . [23, 35, 25, 44, 56, 78, 62, 92, 94, 47] . Converting Data Types to and from JSON . This is useful for converting Python lists containing integers to a string. It can be used when connecting backend code (Python) to frontend code (JavaScript) . The following shows us assigning a variable “a” to a list of integers that has been converted to a string using json.dumps . import json lst = [1,2,3,4] print(type(lst)) a = json.dumps(lst) print(a) print(type(a)) . &lt;class &#39;list&#39;&gt; [1, 2, 3, 4] &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; . Popcorn Hack 5 . Convert a list of integers in Python to a string using JSON. Assign a new variable to the newly converted string and print it. Also print the type of the new variable to ensure it is a string. Hack 1 . Sort the variables in the code cell below into these categories and write the adjoining numbers for each type: Integer: | List: | Boolean: | String: | . # Variable 1 numStudents = 26 print(numStudents) # Variable 2 car = &quot;Tesla&quot; print(car) # Variable 3 groupMates = [&quot;Nikki&quot;, &quot;Monika&quot;, &quot;Ankit&quot;, &quot;Varun&quot;] print(groupMates) # Variable 4 dogsbeatcats = True print(dogsbeatcats) . 26 Tesla [&#39;Nikki&#39;, &#39;Monika&#39;, &#39;Ankit&#39;, &#39;Varun&#39;] True . Hack 2 . Now in a separate code cell, define one variable for each type above! Make them unique to your interests and be creative. For your list, convert it to a string using JSON and print it out.",

            "content": "Lets start off with the basics. What is an algorithm? . An algorithm is a procedure or formula used for solving a problem. It has a sequence of events, inputs, and outputs. | . What are algorithms used for? . Algorithms are used in many different aspect of life. For example a form of routine is an algorithm as it is a series of specified events. | . Why are algorithms important? . It solves a problem in a way that it can be applied to any similar problem. It allows the computer to solve the problem on its own w/o any form of human interference. | . # Psuedo Code 1 DISPLAY (&quot;What is the temperature outside in F?&quot;) temp &lt;- INPUT() IF (temp &gt;= 90) { DISPLAY(&quot;its too hot outide&quot;) } ELSE { IF (temp &gt;= 65){ DISPLAY (&quot;sure I will play outside&quot;) } ELSE { DISPLAY (&quot;its too cold outside&quot;) } } # Psuedo Code 2 DISPLAY (&quot;What is the temperature outside in F?&quot;) temp &lt;- INPUT() IF (temp &gt;= 90) { DISPLAY(&quot;its too hot outide&quot;) } IF (temp &gt;= 65) { DISPLAY (&quot;sure I will play outside&quot;) } IF (temp &lt; 65) { DISPLAY (&quot;its too cold outside&quot;) } . What is the difference between the two pieces of code in the cell above? . # Code 1 print(&quot;What is the temperature outside in F?&quot;) temp = int(input()) if temp &gt;= 90: print(&quot;its too hot outide&quot;) else: if temp &gt;= 65: print(&quot;sure I will play outside&quot;) else: print(&quot;its too cold outside&quot;) . # Code 2 print(&quot;What is the temperature outside in F?&quot;) temp = int(input()) if temp &gt;= 90: print(&quot;its too hot outide&quot;) if temp &gt;= 65: print(&quot;sure I will play outside&quot;) if temp &lt; 65: print(&quot;its too cold outside&quot;) . What is the temperature outside in F? its too hot outide sure I will play outside . What happens if we plug 56 for the temp? What happens if we plug 95 in? . If we plug 56 in, then it will display the text “its too cold outside.” It first checks the first input, if temp is greater than or equal to 90. Which it isn’t so it moves on to the next if. If temp is greater than or equal to 65, which it isn’t so it checks the last if/else statement and displays the text its too cold outside. . If we plug 95 in we get two different results. Code one displays “its too hot outide” but code two displays “its too hot outide” and “sure I will play outside.” Why is this? . Popcorn Hack #1 . Adjust Pseudo Code #2 so that it has the same output as Code #1 for all inputs. . # Insert your code here: . Conditionals vs Booleans . Quick reminder: . Conditionals: checks if a condition is true or false using statements like if, elif, and else if. | Booleans: Data type that conditionals use, only two: true and false | . We have given an algorithm that uses conditionals and two boolean statements that should have the same output as the conditional. Which boolean statement works and which one doesn’t? . Conditional: . # Psuedo Code IF (isHoliday) { driveWork&lt;- False } ELSE { IF (iswWeekday) { driveWork &lt;_ True } ELSE { driveWork &lt;- False } } . Boolean . # Option 1: driveWork &lt;- ( (isHoliday) AND (isWeekday)) # Option 2: driveWork &lt;- ( (NOT (isHoliday)) AND (isWeekday)) . Answer . | . Option 2 is the correct answer . Popcorn Hack #2 . Using the commands listed below, move the robot (gray triangle) through the white squares to the gray square wihtout touching the black squares in the least amount of lines as possible. . Commands allowed: MOVE_FORWARD() . moves the robot one sqaure in the direction it is facing ROTATE_LEFT() | rotates the robot 90 degrees counterclockwise relative to itself ROTATE_RIGHT() | rotates the robot 90 degrees clockwise relative to itself CAN_MOVE() | checks if the robot can move forward in true or false (true: it can move forward. false: it can’t move forward) | . | . # Insert your code here: . Optional Popcorn Hack . Change your code to an algorithm that works for any given course. . Hint: use if, elif, else, and CAN_MOVE() . # Insert your code here: . Combining Selection and/or Iteration . Create an algorithm that uses selection and/or iteration to determine the cost of one item. THe display at the stores says the follorwing: . Green tagged items: 25% off | Red tagged items: 60% off | Tax on all items is 10% | . # Psuedo Code DISPLAY (&quot;What is the cost of the item?&quot;) cost &lt;- INPUT() DIPLAY (&quot;Is the tag green or red (type &quot;True&quot; if it is green, type &quot;False&quot; for red)&quot;) tag &lt;- BOOL(INPUT()) IF (tag == True) # Check if it is green tag (refer to lines above) { cost &lt;- 0.75 * cost } IF (tag == False) # Check if it is green tag (refer to lines above) { cost &lt;- 0.40 * cost } cost &lt;- 1.10 * cost . print(&quot;What is the cost of the item?&quot;) cost = int(input()) print(&quot;Is the tag green or red (type &quot;True&quot; if it is green, type &quot;False&quot; for red)&quot;) tag = bool(input()) if tag == True: # Check if it is green tag (refer to lines above) cost = 0.75 * cost if tag == False: # Check if it is green tag (refer to lines above) cost = 0.40 * cost cost = 1.10 * cost # accounting for tax . Famous Collatz Conjecture . Start with any positive integer | IF that number is even, divide by 2 | If that number is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1 | Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you reach the number 1 | 6 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 10 -&gt; 5 -&gt; 16 -&gt; 8 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1 . Collatz proposed that this sequence of numbers would always terminate at 1. The problem of whether this is true or not for all positive integers is still unsolved today. . Lets create an algorithm that will start with any positive integer “n” and display the full sequence of numbers that result from this conjecture. . # Psuedo Code DISPLAY (&quot;choose a value for n&quot;) n &lt;- INPUT() DISPLAY (n) REPEAT UNTIL (n = 1) { IF (n MOD 2 = 0) { n &lt;- n/2 } ELSE { n &lt;- 3 * n + 1 } DISPLAY (n) } . # Code print(&quot;choose a value for n&quot;) n = int(input()) print(n) while n != 1: if n % 2 == 0: n = n/2 else: n = (n*3)+1 print(n) . choose a value for n 6 3.0 10.0 5.0 16.0 8.0 4.0 2.0 1.0 . Popcorn hack #3 . We are given an algorhtim (below) for a robot to move from the current square to the grey square, completing the course (below). However it doesn’t work. Why does the given algorithm not work? . Using the commands listed below, fix the algorithm . Commands allowed: MOVE_FORWARD() . moves the robot one sqaure in the direction it is facing ROTATE_LEFT() | rotates the robot 90 degrees counterclockwise relative to itself ROTATE_RIGHT() | rotates the robot 90 degrees clockwise relative to itself CAN_MOVE() | checks if the robot can move forward in true or false (true: it can move forward. false: it can’t move forward) | . Course: . | . Given Algorithm . REPEAT UNTIL (goalReached) { IF (CAN_MOVE(FORWARD)) { MOVE_FORWARD } ELSE { IF CAN_MOVE(RIGHT) { ROTATE_RIGHT MOVE_FORWARD } } } . Put your answer to the question “Why does the given algorithm not work?” here: . # Insert your updated algorithm here: . Homework .

I am looking for Projects that help students gain a passion for College Board Big Idea 2 - Data. . Evidence of understanding of Big Idea 2: Binary, Data Compression, and Extracting Information from Data are key topics. Both College Board and Tech Talks will support Ideation on these topics. | In teams, with success on Team Test, there was typically a great division of work. Dividing and Conquering was very evident, these skills will continue to be very important as you move to first objective of Ideation. | In video production, teams were very effective in budgeting time. Thus, your Teacher was able to complete 40 minutes of reviews in an hour. As you go forward in Ideation reviews, you should consider techniques that allow you divide and conquer and stay in budget of time. | . Product Owner Ideas . The recent Student Panel talked about making projects out of something you see, do, need, or like. Right now, you must see “College Board Big Ideas” and “Collaboration” per this “Product Owner requirements document”. . Turn something you are required to do into a passion project. The Teacher got really excited about binary counting visualiztion/games, manipulating images (grey scale/sizing), and machine learning when reading and studying these College Board topics. However, since I would like to build my skills and capabilities before working on something that complex, I started my journey by building a simple list of Jokes to learn how to do APIs. | . This project has many layers of investigation. Ideation code start on APIs. Looking at these screens can be very helpful in meeting multiple requirements for this project (Prentation design - UI, Data Design - UML). . API Design | Jokes API. | Covid API | . Frontend/Binary. A key object of this class is learning and using binary. Doing something like this can help the Frontend developers to learn Frontend Development without the need to wait for Backend developers to provide depenencies. There is a frontend description here. This page contains a link to a Frontend binary project. Adding features to this could include 2^N labels under each bit (lightbulb) to assist in understanding. Making a calculator to add two binary numbers together. Showing how binary numbers are used to represent color. Combining ideas from the Game of Life, binary, and colors to make a tool to sketch and teach binary. . Backend/Data Compression. Using Python libaries and only Python/Flask it is possible to become very adept in backend code, but also do visualization. Here is a project that I envisioned worth visiting Lassen National Park. This includes features such as blur, grey scale, etc. There are red, blue, and green scale functions that are easier adaptations to this project. Building this and then providing uploads, api transport over base64 and persistance for images on server is a wonderful learning project and something the Teacher wants in his coffer of repos. . Backend/ML. This really needs no introduction. There is so much going on in this space. The key to this project would be to have data that a user(s) provide to make the learning model dynmic and immersive in a short demo at N@tM. . Deployment. Unless a project is versioned controlled, has a README, and is deployed (with AWS in our case) it is not useful to you or your Teacher. Every project we have should be stored and shared. This is the key to development and to turning coding into usefulness. . Realizations and Adjustments to thinking .

Changing Code will require Deployment Updates . Changing Code in VSCode . To keep deployment working, good practices in your coding process with verifications prior to pushing code to GitHub will save a lot of troubleshooting. . Make sure to git pull before making changes This will make sure that you pull any changes made by your team, and prevents merge conflicts . | Open terminal in VSCode and run python3 main.py (Make sure you cd into your repo) This should give you a local address where your flask is running. Open this in your browser to see your changes live . | Make changes that are needed Refer to your running site often to see changes as you develop . | Commit your changes locally Do not Sync change from UI or git push from terminal yet, just Commit. It is great practice to Commit Often with sensible comments. Anytime after you commit you can pull team members changes for additional verifications. . | Before updating deployment start Docker Desktop app and test your Web Application. Test docker-compose up or sudo docker-compose up in your VSCode terminal (don’t forget to ‘cd’ into the right repo). . | After Docker is done building, type in http://localhost:8 in your browser. Replace ‘8—’ with your port number. Review your personal changes and team members changes in running site. As long as Docker Desktop and Docker App is running, you can make little changes and save, they should refresh in site within a few seconds. Any errors, runtime errors, will appear in browser of VSCode terminal, read messages thoroughly and debug errors. Docker Desktop may consume a lot of CPU resources, if you are unplugged you may want to close it after you are done testing. . | If all goes well, Sync change from UI or git push from terminal. If you can’t push review git status from terminal. Resolve all open files git restore or git commit, then git pull and repeat steps 5 to 7. . | Pulling Changes into AWS EC2 deployment . Updates should be quick and easy, as long as your teams verifies problems on localhost prior to these steps. . In your AWS EC2 terminal; . Navigate to your repo: cd ~/my_unique_name . | docker-compose down Test Server in browser using https://, it should be down (502 Bad Gateway in browser) . | git pull . | Rebuild your docker container: docker-compose up -d --build Test Server in browser using https://, sll updates should be up and running on internet. . | Optional, Troubleshooting checks on AWS EC2 . These commands let you see status of your running web application on AWS EC2 . Try to curl: curl localhost:8 (replace ‘8—’ with your port number) Verify home pages is yours . | Run docker-compose ps Perform check on your container, verify docker is up . | Run docker ps Perform checks on all containers and all images . | Cockpit Navigation . This portion will cover Cockpit’s features. Login to Cockpit by accessing your subdomain. . The left navigation bar in Cockpit presents a few options that you can select: . Overview . The overview section provides a summary of health, usage, system, and configuration information. Click on “View details and history” to check CPU, memory, and network settings. . Logs . These provide information about the system, such as a failed login. Logs can be filtered based on criteria such as time or priority. . Storage . See disk read and write settings and storage logs. . Networking . This portion shows the network traffic of the server and interface information. VLANs and bridges can also be added here. . Accounts . This setting allows the administrator to create and manage accounts. You can click on a user to edit user settings, such as changing the password and adding SSH keys. . Services . Click on a service to view its settings. A service can be reloaded, restarted, or stopped by clicking on the three dots. The dropdown under “Show relationships” includes information such as a service’s dependencies and when it starts in relation with other services (what services start before and after this service) . Software Updates . If you are running Ubuntu 17.10 or later, a “Loading available updates failed” error message will appear. This is because Ubuntu changed the network management from network-manager to netplan.io, which has not been updated in Cockpit. A way to fix this is to change netplan’s configuration file to manage one interface with network-manager. . sudo nano /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml . Next, add the following line under network: . renderer: NetworkManager . Then, execute . sudo netplan try . Refresh Cockpit, and the “Software Updates” page should work. Updates can now be installed. . Terminal . A command line interface that is the same as the machine’s terminal on AWS EC2. . Update hostname and system time . Go to Overview -&gt; Configuration -&gt; Click on “edit” next to “Hostname” and configure a hostname for the server. . Click on the time next to “System time” to set the time zone. . User account settings . Go to Accounts -&gt; Click on “Create new account” and fill out the boxes . After the user is created, click on the user. You can check “Server administrator” to give the user sudo privileges. . You can also configure account expiration and password expiration settings by clicking on “edit” next to the two settings. . . To test the new user account created, logout, and then login with the new user credentials. If the user has administrative privileges, you can click on the button that says “Limited access” at the top right corner to gain those privileges. . Note: If the user was not configured as a “Server administrator” and tried to gain admin privileges by clicking the button, the attempt will fail and will be logged. You can view the log by clicking on “Logs” in the sidebar: . . Congratulations! . Congratulations on deploying your site with AWS! .",

            "content": "Setting up Spritesheet . This blog will go through the steps by using this spritesheet as a demonstration: . Download the image into your files. Then, create an image folder in the _notebooks directory and save this image in that folder. . . Base HTML . Create the webpage layout of your animation, including the div in which each image is generated. Below is HTML for a very basic structure which can be used to test your sprites: . &lt;body&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;canvas id=&quot;spriteContainer&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- Within the base div is a canvas. An HTML canvas is used only for graphics. It allows the user to access some basic functions related to the image created on the canvas (including animation) --&gt; &lt;img id=&quot;dogSprite&quot; src=&quot;/teacher/images/dogSprites.png&quot;&gt; &lt;/canvas&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;controls&quot;&gt; &lt;!--basic radio buttons which can be used to check whether each individual animaiton works --&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;radio&quot; name=&quot;animation&quot; id=&quot;idle&quot; checked&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;idle&quot;&gt;Idle&lt;/label&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;radio&quot; name=&quot;animation&quot; id=&quot;barking&quot;&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;barking&quot;&gt;Barking&lt;/label&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;radio&quot; name=&quot;animation&quot; id=&quot;walking&quot;&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;walking&quot;&gt;Walking&lt;/label&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/body&gt; . Setting up Javascript . Set up the main function, which will contain the object class for the animation, including the parameters of the object, and the different methods of what the object can do. . For most cases, it is simplest to have the function called when the page is loaded, which would ensure the code works every time someone opens the game. We will also set a few variables, which are further explained in the code comments. . Since we are switching over to Javascript, be sure to put all code within the &lt;script&gt; tag, which will allow the computer to know the code is no longer HTML . &lt;script&gt; window.addEventListener(&#39;load&#39;, function () { const canvas = document.getElementById(&#39;spriteContainer&#39;); // sets the canvas as a variable by calling the canvas element from the HTML code, using the id we set const ctx = canvas.getContext(&#39;2d&#39;); // the getContext function is a given function within the canvas object. It allows us more functionality with the sprite image. // constant variables used for sprite const SPRITE_WIDTH = 160; const SPRITE_HEIGHT = 144; const FRAME_LIMIT = 48; // sets canvas properties const SCALE_FACTOR = 2; canvas.width = SPRITE_WIDTH * SCALE_FACTOR; canvas.height = SPRITE_HEIGHT * SCALE_FACTOR; //more code will be placed here later }); &lt;/script&gt; . NOTE: the particular sprite sheet given for this animation has sprites that are 160 by 144 pixels. Setting the width and height as a variable allows us to change the scale easily. When using other sprite sheets, be sure to find out what the dimensions of the sprite are . Using Object Oriented Programming . Object Oriented Programming is a model in programming which creates ‘objects’. Specific data or parameters can then be assigned to the object in classes. The classes are essentially ‘blueprints’, which can be used to create more instances of the same object. This makes it easier to reuse and keep track of data. . We are going to create a class for our sprite. Each class can have different methods, which are functions assigned to each class. Our sprite object will have 3 methods; constructor method, draw method, and update method . The constructor method sets the values which will be assigned to this class. The values assigned are explained in the code’s comments . We are also creating a draw method, in order to ‘draw’ the image on the canvas created earlier. The parameters given to the method are the same we set in the constructor method . place this class structure within the onLoad function we created earlier . class Dog { constructor(){ // constructor method for outlining data points about the sprite this.image = document.getElementById(&quot;dogSprite&quot;); this.spriteWidth = SPRITE_WIDTH; this.spriteHeight = SPRITE_HEIGHT; this.width = this.spriteWidth; //takes sprite dimensions and accounts for it in image generation this.height = this.spriteHeight; this.x = 0; //starts image generation in coordinate (0,0) px on sprite sheet this.y = 0; this.scale = 1; //scale of image this.minFrame = 0; this.maxFrame = FRAME_LIMIT; // how many sprites there are in a row this.frameX = 0; // sets position of sprite that is being generated. There are the two parameters we will be changing in order to crete the animation. this.frameY = 0; } draw(context) { context.drawImage( this.image, this.frameX * this.spriteWidth, this.frameY * this.spriteHeight, this.spriteWidth, this.spriteHeight, this.x, this.y, this.width * this.scale, this.height * this.scale ); } . How the animation works . As mentioned above, the sprite sheet contains sprites placed side by side at even intervals. The code we write will generate an image with the dimensions 160 by 144 pixels, since that is the size of an individual sprite. The first image generated starts at the origin point (0,0) px. The update method will then shift the origin point over to the right by 160 pixels, so that the next image generated is the 2nd frame. . Writing the Update Method . class Dog { constructor() { this.image = document.getElementById(&quot;dogSprite&quot;); this.x = 0; this.y = 0; this.minFrame = 0; this.maxFrame = FRAME_LIMIT; this.frameX = 0; this.frameY = 0; } // draw dog object draw(context) { context.drawImage( this.image, this.frameX * SPRITE_WIDTH, this.frameY * SPRITE_HEIGHT, SPRITE_WIDTH, SPRITE_HEIGHT, this.x, this.y, canvas.width, canvas.height ); } // update frameX of object update() { if (this.frameX &lt; this.maxFrame) { this.frameX++; } else { this.frameX = 0; } } } } . NOTE: This code only plays one of the three animations. In other words only one row of the sprite sheet is being played. In order to have the animation change, we will need to code user inputs into the update method. . Making Your Animation User Responsive . In order to make our animations adaptive to user inputs, we can use eventListeners to detect when a user clicks on a different button. While we are using radio buttons in this example, eventListeners can be set to detect other user inputs, such as a mouse movement or keystroke, or even an in-game event like losing the game. . These eventListeners will then trigger a certain function which changes the animation on the screen. . The parameter this.frameY is what controls which animation is being played, but we can change its value through eventListeners. ‘Idle’ would set this.frameY equal to 0, which would play the first row of animation on the spreadsheet (remember: python starts it’s index from 0). The “bark” button would play the second row by setting this.frameY equal to 1, and so on. . Place the following code after the Dog class . const dog = new Dog(); // This makes the game object, Dog // Add event listener to the parent container for event delegation const controls = document.getElementById(&#39;controls&#39;); controls.addEventListener(&#39;click&#39;, function (event) { if (event.target.tagName === &#39;INPUT&#39;) { const selectedAnimation = event.target.id; switch (selectedAnimation) { case &#39;idle&#39;: dog.frameY = 0; break; case &#39;barking&#39;: dog.frameY = 1; break; case &#39;walking&#39;: dog.frameY = 2; break; default: break; } } }); . Calling Class Methods . All the functions have been written; all thats left is to put them together by calling them when the page loads. . Place the following code outside after previous code, but still within the onLoad function: . // Animation recursive control function function animate() { // Clears the canvas to remove the previous frame. ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height); // Draws the current frame of the sprite. dog.draw(ctx); // Updates the `frameX` property to prepare for the next frame in the sprite sheet. dog.update(); // Uses `requestAnimationFrame` to synchronize the animation loop with the display&#39;s refresh rate, // ensuring smooth visuals. requestAnimationFrame(animate); } animate(); . Put It all Together . Create a new HTML file and place all the code together! The animation should run similar to the example show below . Hacks . Try and see if you can get the animation to respond to different user inputs (other then the radio buttons) . | Or; get the dog sprite to actually move across the screen during the walk animation using translations . | . your code should end up looking like the example below . %%html &lt;body&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;canvas id=&quot;spriteContainer&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- Within the base div is a canvas. An HTML canvas is used only for graphics. It allows the user to access some basic functions related to the image created on the canvas (including animation) --&gt; &lt;img id=&quot;dogSprite&quot; src=&quot;/teacher/images/dogSprites.png&quot;&gt; // change sprite here &lt;/canvas&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;controls&quot;&gt; &lt;!--basic radio buttons which can be used to check whether each individual animaiton works --&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;radio&quot; name=&quot;animation&quot; id=&quot;idle&quot; checked&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;idle&quot;&gt;Idle&lt;/label&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;radio&quot; name=&quot;animation&quot; id=&quot;barking&quot;&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;barking&quot;&gt;Barking&lt;/label&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;radio&quot; name=&quot;animation&quot; id=&quot;walking&quot;&gt; &lt;label for=&quot;walking&quot;&gt;Walking&lt;/label&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;script&gt; // start on page load window.addEventListener(&#39;load&#39;, function () { const canvas = document.getElementById(&#39;spriteContainer&#39;); const ctx = canvas.getContext(&#39;2d&#39;); const SPRITE_WIDTH = 160; // matches sprite pixel width const SPRITE_HEIGHT = 144; // matches sprite pixel height const FRAME_LIMIT = 48; // matches number of frames per sprite row, this code assume each row is same const SCALE_FACTOR = 2; // control size of sprite on canvas canvas.width = SPRITE_WIDTH * SCALE_FACTOR; canvas.height = SPRITE_HEIGHT * SCALE_FACTOR; class Dog { constructor() { this.image = document.getElementById(&quot;dogSprite&quot;); this.x = 0; this.y = 0; this.minFrame = 0; this.maxFrame = FRAME_LIMIT; this.frameX = 0; this.frameY = 0; } // draw dog object draw(context) { context.drawImage( this.image, this.frameX * SPRITE_WIDTH, this.frameY * SPRITE_HEIGHT, SPRITE_WIDTH, SPRITE_HEIGHT, this.x, this.y, canvas.width, canvas.height ); } // update frameX of object update() { if (this.frameX &lt; this.maxFrame) { this.frameX++; } else { this.frameX = 0; } } } // dog object const dog = new Dog(); // update frameY of dog object, action from idle, bark, walk radio control const controls = document.getElementById(&#39;controls&#39;); controls.addEventListener(&#39;click&#39;, function (event) { if (event.target.tagName === &#39;INPUT&#39;) { const selectedAnimation = event.target.id; switch (selectedAnimation) { case &#39;idle&#39;: dog.frameY = 0; break; case &#39;barking&#39;: dog.frameY = 1; break; case &#39;walking&#39;: dog.frameY = 2; break; default: break; } } }); // Animation recursive control function function animate() { // Clears the canvas to remove the previous frame. ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height); // Draws the current frame of the sprite. dog.draw(ctx); // Updates the `frameX` property to prepare for the next frame in the sprite sheet. dog.update(); // Uses `requestAnimationFrame` to synchronize the animation loop with the display&#39;s refresh rate, // ensuring smooth visuals. requestAnimationFrame(animate); } // run 1st animate animate(); }); &lt;/script&gt; . // change sprite here Idle Barking Walking",

            "content": "Overview . Machine learning is a powerful and expanding field within artifical intelligence. It has found applications throughout a variety of industries. At its core, machine learning is driven by algorithms and models that enable computers to learn and make predictions based on already available (test) data. Machine learning is utilized in today’s world to predict disease outcomes, analyze medical images, detect fraud, predict market trends, and much more. Its ability to extract insights from complex datasets to make data driven decisions enhances efficiency, unlocks otherwise hidden patterns, and make predictions that have been impossible in the past… . The Machine Learning Process . . Data Sample . Below is fitbit data detailing 20 workouts, their duration, my heartbeat, workout type, and the resulting calories I burnt. As an athlete I want to maximize the amount of calories I burn, so I can optimize my workouts. However, due to the various factors involved in burning calories, the best way to achieve my goal is a machine learning model. . Duration (minutes) | Heart Rate (bpm) | Intensity Level | Calories Burned 30 | 120 | 3 | 200 45 | 140 | 6 | 300 60 | 160 | 9 | 400 20 | 110 | 2 | 150 35 | 130 | 5 | 250 50 | 150 | 8 | 350 25 | 125 | 4 | 180 40 | 145 | 7 | 280 55 | 165 | 10 | 410 30 | 120 | 3 | 210 45 | 140 | 6 | 320 60 | 160 | 9 | 390 20 | 110 | 2 | 160 35 | 130 | 5 | 240 50 | 150 | 8 | 360 25 | 125 | 4 | 170 40 | 145 | 7 | 270 55 | 165 | 10 | 400 30 | 120 | 3 | 220 45 | 140 | 6 | 310 . Data Preprocessing . Given the fitness dataset, we first establish the following variables: Dependent Variable: . Calories Burned | . Independent Variables: . Duration : length of the workout in minutes | Heart Rate : average rate of heart beat in beats per minute during the workout | Intensity level : Workout intensity level from a scale of 1 (sitting) to 10 (sprinting) These independent variables were chosen for this model because they are believed to be the most relevant factors affecting calories burned. . | . The dependent variable, Calories Burned, is the target variable the model will aim to predict. It represents the amount of calories burned during a specific fitness activity. The Independent variables will be the inputs used to predict the dependent variable using a linear regression model. The linear regression model will analyze the relationship between the independent and dependent variables in order to create accurate predictions. This can be done easily using the scikit-learn library in Python. See installation instructions here. You will also need pandas. . Variable Relationship Visualization . These visualizations are meant to show the relationship between the independent variables and dependent variable (target calories burnt) . pip install matplotlib . import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Load the fitness dataset into a pandas DataFrame data = pd.DataFrame({ &#39;Duration&#39;: [30, 45, 60, 20, 35, 50, 25, 40, 55, 30, 45, 60, 20, 35, 50, 25, 40, 55, 30, 45], &#39;Heart Rate&#39;: [120, 140, 160, 110, 130, 150, 125, 145, 165, 120, 140, 160, 110, 130, 150, 125, 145, 165, 120, 140], &#39;Intensity Level&#39;: [3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 4, 7, 10, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 4, 7, 10, 3, 6], &#39;Calories Burned&#39;: [200, 300, 400, 150, 250, 350, 180, 280, 410, 210, 320, 390, 160, 240, 360, 170, 270, 400, 220, 310] }) #Duration vs. Calories Burned plt.scatter(data[&#39;Duration&#39;], data[&#39;Calories Burned&#39;], label=&#39;Data&#39;) plt.xlabel(&#39;Duration (minutes)&#39;) plt.ylabel(&#39;Calories Burned&#39;) plt.title(&#39;Duration vs. Calories Burned&#39;) plt.legend() plt.show() #Heart Rate vs. Calories Burned plt.scatter(data[&#39;Heart Rate&#39;], data[&#39;Calories Burned&#39;], label=&#39;Data&#39;) plt.xlabel(&#39;Heart Rate (bpm)&#39;) plt.ylabel(&#39;Calories Burned&#39;) plt.title(&#39;Heart Rate vs. Calories Burned&#39;) plt.legend() plt.show() # Intensity Level vs. Calories Burned plt.scatter(data[&#39;Intensity Level&#39;], data[&#39;Calories Burned&#39;], label=&#39;Data&#39;) plt.xlabel(&#39;Intensity Level&#39;) plt.ylabel(&#39;Calories Burned&#39;) plt.title(&#39;Intensity Level vs. Calories Burned&#39;) plt.legend() plt.show() . . . . Splitting the Data . This dataset includes 15 rows of TRAIN fitbit data and 5 rows of TEST data, with various combinations of duration, heart rate, workout type, and the corresponding calories burned.

Model Training and Evaluation . In this code, we start by loading the fitness dataset into a pandas DataFrame. Then, we split the dataset into training and test data using train_test_split (just as before). We assign the independent variables (Duration, Heart Rate, Intensity Level) and the dependent variable (Calories Burned) to separate variables for both the training and test data. . Next, we create a linear regression model using LinearRegression(). We fit the model to the training data by calling fit and passing in the training features and target variables (X_train and y_train). . After fitting the model, we use it to make predictions on the test data by calling predict and passing in the test features (X_test). The predicted values are stored in y_pred. This way we can test the accuracy of the model with real data. . Finally, we calculate the mean squared error (MSE) between the actual target values (y_test) and the predicted values (y_pred) using the mean_squared_error function from scikit-learn. The MSE provides a measure of the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values. It is a measure of how well the model performs on the test data, where lower value indicates a better performance. We print the calculated MSE to evaluate the performance of the model. . In summary, this code demonstrates the process of splitting the dataset into training and test data, creating a linear regression model, fitting it, and then calculating the margin of error in testing. . import pandas as pd from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error # Load the fitness dataset into a pandas DataFrame data = pd.DataFrame({ &#39;Duration&#39;: [30, 45, 60, 20, 35, 50, 25, 40, 55, 30, 45, 60, 20, 35, 50, 25, 40, 55, 30, 45], &#39;Heart Rate&#39;: [120, 140, 160, 110, 130, 150, 125, 145, 165, 120, 140, 160, 110, 130, 150, 125, 145, 165, 120, 140], &#39;Intensity Level&#39;: [3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 4, 7, 10, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 4, 7, 10, 3, 6], &#39;Calories Burned&#39;: [200, 300, 400, 150, 250, 350, 180, 280, 410, 210, 320, 390, 160, 240, 360, 170, 270, 400, 220, 310] }) # Split the dataset into training and test data train_data, test_data = train_test_split(data, test_size=5, random_state=42) # Separate the features (X) and the target variable (y) for training and test data X_train = train_data[[&#39;Duration&#39;, &#39;Heart Rate&#39;, &#39;Intensity Level&#39;]] y_train = train_data[&#39;Calories Burned&#39;] X_test = test_data[[&#39;Duration&#39;, &#39;Heart Rate&#39;, &#39;Intensity Level&#39;]] y_test = test_data[&#39;Calories Burned&#39;] # Create a linear regression model model = LinearRegression() # Fit the model to the training data model.fit(X_train, y_train) # Make predictions on the test data y_pred = model.predict(X_test) # Calculate the mean squared error mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred) print(&quot;Mean Squared Error:&quot;, mse) . Mean Squared Error: 569.4444444444464 . Model Testing and Interpretation . The mean squared error represents the inaccuracy of the model. A mean squared error of 569.444 indicates that the model is quite inaccurate. In general this can be fixed through a few ways: . Feature Engineering: Exploring other relevant factors to the variable “calories burned”. This may be even categorical like activity type. This would require changing your original dataset. | Data Cleaning: Reviewing the database for missing data, outliers, or inconsistent data.This would also require changing your original dataset. | Feature Scaling: Normalize the data so they are on a similar numerical scale. For example, calories burned is on a quite larger scale than intensity level. (up to 410 for calories versus up to 10 for intensity) | 4. Regularization: IMPORTANT CONCEPT ~ This is a method to prevent overfitting, which is essentially when the model “memorizes” data rather than associating. Think of it like this.. Say you are trying to study for a math test. You could go about it two ways: The first option is that you memorize all of the answers on your homework to a T. The other option is to take time to understand the concept so you are prepared for whatever may come your way on the test. Which would you choose? You probably said it is a better idea to choose the second option. If you chose the first option and saw something unfamiliar on the test, you would have no idea how to answer it! In this way, overfitting data is similar to option 1 (memorization). You do not want your model to be over-trained, or overfitted because it must be able to respond to a variety of data rather than just ‘memorize’ the test data. . Changes Made: . Polynomial Features: . Polynomial features are created using ‘PolynomialFeatures’ from scikit-learn. | The degree determines the maximum power to which each independent can be raised to. The degree=2, is an arbritary number. It depends on many factors like the complexity of the model, etc. but for simplcity it is customary to start at around 1-2 and then incrementally increase the degree, and reevaluate the models performance at each step. | By introducing polynomial features, the model can model non-linear relationships between the independent variables and the target variable. This flexibility allows the model to fit more complex patterns in the data and reduce the MSE. | Also this may indirectly affect the feature scaling, but it is not the primary purpose | . Ridge Regression: . Ridge regression is utilized using ‘Ridge’ from scikit-learn. It is a regularization technique. Essentially, every variable is given a ‘weight’ in how much it contributes to the end prediction. For example, the intensity level may have a higher weight, or impact on the calorie loss compared to duration of the workout. Ridge regression basically encourages the model to have smaller weights for each feature so the model doesn’t overfit or memorize as explained earlier. This controls the model’s complexity and again avoids overfitting. | By adding a small positive alpha (alpha=0.1 in this case), the model’s coefficients, or weights are penalized. This regularization helps reduce the impact of irrelevant features and prevents overfitting. | . Pipeline: . A pipeline is constructed using make_pipeline from scikit-learn. In simple terms: It combines multiple preprocessing steps into a single one | Using a pipeline allows for a more streamlined and concise implementation. It ensures that the transformations(mentioned above) are applied consistently to both the training and test data. | This is not an actual modification to the data/methods used | . import pandas as pd from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error # Load the fitness dataset into a pandas DataFrame data = pd.DataFrame({ &#39;Duration&#39;: [30, 45, 60, 20, 35, 50, 25, 40, 55, 30, 45, 60, 20, 35, 50, 25, 40, 55, 30, 45], &#39;Heart Rate&#39;: [120, 140, 160, 110, 130, 150, 125, 145, 165, 120, 140, 160, 110, 130, 150, 125, 145, 165, 120, 140], &#39;Intensity Level&#39;: [3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 4, 7, 10, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 4, 7, 10, 3, 6], &#39;Calories Burned&#39;: [200, 300, 400, 150, 250, 350, 180, 280, 410, 210, 320, 390, 160, 240, 360, 170, 270, 400, 220, 310] }) # Split the dataset into training and test data X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data[[&#39;Duration&#39;, &#39;Heart Rate&#39;, &#39;Intensity Level&#39;]], data[&#39;Calories Burned&#39;], test_size=0.2, random_state=42) # Create a pipeline with polynomial features and Ridge regression model = make_pipeline(PolynomialFeatures(degree=2), Ridge(alpha=0.1)) # Fit the model to the training data model.fit(X_train, y_train) # Make predictions on the test data y_pred = model.predict(X_test) # Calculate the mean squared error mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred) print(&quot;Mean Squared Error:&quot;, mse) . Mean Squared Error: 108.33239800289937 . As you can see, the MSE (the inaccuracy) decreased significantly after the last change. I suggest you . Interactive Model Testing . The code below will run in terminal. It is an interactive model, where the user can enter their workout duration, heart rate, intensity level. They will recieve a prediction or estimate created by the linear regression model on number of calories burned. The user can input the actual number of calories burned to recieve an accuracy. .

Hacks . Build a proper web frontend for this (or your own) regression model. (Machine learning can be a complicated concept…How can you make a simple UI to present the model to the user in an efficient way?) | Use real test cases on this model (Collect data from a real group of people - a sports team for example- and see if the calorie loss prediction is actually accurate. If the model is innacurate, what are some ways we discussed in the lesson to reduce innacuracy? Try implementing those ways!) | Add more components/independen variables to compliment the model. (How can you incorporate something like categorical- non numerical- data for example? What would this entail? Will adding more numerical categories increase the models accuracy.. or just overcomplicate it? Test these things on your own!) | For the math inclined people - try explaining the Math used in the sklearn learning models. Mathematically describe how these predefined methods (such as model.fit) really work. | Try a new machine learning model (decision tree regression, random forest) | Try to find the most important feature (independent variable) to determining calorie loss. (Try comparing coefficients, etc - this may require some more research) | Conclusion and Further Exploration . This lesson introduced the concept of using machine learning, specifically linear regression, to estimate calorie loss during fitness activities. This lesson explored how independent variables such as duration, heart rate, and intensity level can be used to predict the dependent variable, calories burned even when the model is non-linear. . Further Exploration: Here are some videos to watch to learn more about this topic. Researching on your own is HIGHLY encouraged! . A very simple explanation of what multivariable regression is (includes a graphical and mathematical perspective which may appeal to some students) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZ–3sUoNmY | Walkthrough of using sklearn in python for multivariable regression: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYNuzfn5Fx0 | Explains underfitting, overfitting perfectly and gives suggestions! : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3DztvnfAJg | . To further your understanding of machine learning and regression models, here are some suggestions: . Try Different Models: Experiment with other regression models such as decision trees, random forests,K nearest neighboors, and compare their performance to the linear regression model. Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of different models for this specific calorie loss estimation task. Different models are beneficial for their own reasons, it is important to learn how to weigh their pros and cons. . | Data Collection and Preprocessing: Collect a different dataset related to fitness activities (or a topic of your choice) and create your own model using linear regression. Research in incorporating catogorical elements such as “activity type” rather than just numerical ones - this would be an interesting take. . | Evaluation Metrics: Explore alternative evaluation metrics beyond mean squared error (MSE) for regression models. Consider metrics like mean absolute error (MAE) or R-squared to gain further insights into model performance. . | . Machine learning is vast, keep yourself updated! Continuously exploring and experimenting with different techniques, datasets, and evaluation metrics will deepen your proficiency in applying machine learning algorithms for various real-world scenarios. .",

If you are interested into going into any field of STEM - whether it be the medical field, data science, or computer science, you will often be working with large datasets with tons of useful AND useless information. . A skillset that is becoming increasingly important in these areas of work is the ability to effectively query and filter for data in large datasets and draw conclusions based on these filters. . Pandas . Pandas is a Python library that allows for the manipulation, querying, and filtering of data. . Over time, it has become one of the most popular Python libraries for data analysis. . Here is the documentation link: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/ . Our Data . Data is readable in many formats. As someone who is working with datasets, you should be able to recognize what formats are easiest to understand for you and for any program that you write. Here are two of the most common data formats: . JSON: This is a standard file format that is very easy for humans and computers to read and write. It is a compact way to store data. . | CSV: These are comma-separated value files. This is where data has comma delimiters (separaters). . | For the purpose of this notebook, we’ll use a JSON file containing data about the average income level in each of the 50 states in the USA (located in /assets/datasets/income.json) . We will look to first understand and interpret the data ourselves and use Pandas and Numpy to provide insightful statistical information about the dataset that we may not be as easy to find by ourselves. . import pandas as pd df = pd.read_json(&#39;files/income.json&#39;) # This defines the dataframe in question.

Statistical summary . In this example, all the summary statistics generated using: df.describe. . print(df.describe()) . MeanHouseholdIncome count 50.000000 mean 87461.460000 std 13945.982845 min 65156.000000 25% 77532.250000 50% 83675.000000 75% 96389.250000 max 117868.000000 . Statistical Review . As seen in the above output, the dataframe is being described from the information for the column where applicable statistics are present. The “count” statistic for example, is the number of not-empty cells in the mean household income column. The mean is the average mean household income across all 50 states, and the standard deviation is how much the values within the mean household income column deviate from the mean. . It is important to note that in many more complex datasets, there will be multiple columns with explanatory data. In those cases, the df.describe() method will need to be specified based on a specific column. . Conclusion . What are the key takeaways from this lesson? . The purpose is to obtain a basic understanding of working with a dataset, using Pandas dataframes. To obtain a more comprehensive understanding of Pandas capabilities, research operations such as filtering data based on certain criteria, grouping data, or performing calculations on multiple columns. Additional work can be done with these Python modules (ie numpy, matplotlib). . Explain each example briefly and provide a real-world scenario where such an operation would be useful. Every dataset that you work with should have a purpose - that’s what the field of data science is all about. . For instance, in the Household income example, we analyzed a mean household income by state dataset. This could be applicable if someone wanted to find out where the most affordable place to live. . Find the minimum household income | Expand data to look at affordability of areas within state | Perhaps add other factors like employment in those areas | . Additional Resources .

Machine Learning Visit Tutorials Point . Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python. . Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training……After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn’t seen before……For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct….Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . | Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down. .

Geeks for Geeks shows some ideas on working with images. . base64 . Image formats (JPG, PNG) are often called *Binary File formats, it is difficult to pass these over HTTP. Thus, base64 converts binary encoded data (8-bit, ASCII/Unicode) into a text encoded scheme (24 bits, 6-bit Base64 digits). Thus base64 is used to transport and embed binary images into textual assets such as HTML and CSS. .

The goal of FRQ mini-labs is to help you explore, learn to code, and establish the abililty to communicate and collaborate with you team members. Additionally, you will showcase and record; specifically sharing work with another table. Finally, you will edit and share highlights of recording through video editing. . Continuous Communication is Key . If there is one important skill you need to quickly pick up at the start of your Project Journey, it is to plan, communicate, code, communicate, commit, communicate, and share! Let me reiterate it until it sinks into your brain: communicate your work as often as needed! The tech industry moves at a fast pace, so if you want to ensure that all your hard work doesn’t go to waste, communication is essential. . So, how can you achieve that? Here are a few steps: . Regularly update your team members on your progress, even if you’re not finished yet. One effective way to do this is by sharing small nuggets of the most interesting pieces or insights about your work with the relevant people, such as your pair programmer, team, cross over team, and teacher. However, ensure that you organize or prepare beforehand. . You can do this through: . Shareout messages via platforms like Slack, Discord, or Emails. | Pair meetings. | Standup meetings. | Crossover reviews. | Live reviews with your teacher. | . Whenever you come across a noteworthy insight, take the time to prepare your thoughts and share them. The act of preparation and sharing will help you identify gaps, inconsistencies, clarify misunderstandings on key concepts, and more. If these communications go unnoticed, you are not effectively collaborating. . | Find the right sharing cadence for you, your team members, and stakeholders. Experiment with different sharing frequencies until you discover the one that works best for everyone. Sharing only at the end or when you think you are done is the wrong approach. Remember, everything in tech is a “Work in Progress.” Iteration is the path through which great ideas progress into reality. . In school, it’s common to work in isolation for extended periods and share only when we believe we are finished. However, sharing also includes committing code frequently. In the tech industry, there is no time for delayed sharing or late commits. Therefore, increase your sharing pace, do it frequently, and commit your work often! . | FRQ Hacks . During the year we need to learn the four types of FRQs. . Pick a question of type 01 from one of the years posted on the former EXAM page. Solve the problem, including missing pieces in a Jupyter Notebook. | Make this a quality blog. My suggestion each member of team do a different type of FRQ, to make reviews and grading more valuable. | Browse through multiple questions, find questions that mayhave future PBL interest for you or team. FRQ No. 1: Methods and Control Structures | FRQ No. 2: Classes | FRQ No. 3: Array/ArrayList | FRQ No. 4: 2D Array | . | . Regarding Array/ArrayList/2D Arrays . It is really import that each student learn to iterate through Arrays, ArrayLists, and 2D arrays. On these FRQs, make sure you do some extra work to highlight these concepts, if they are not present in the FRQ. . Change or add data to arrays, easier for ArrayList. How would you do it for others? | Displaying Array/ArrayList by columns, as well as by rows horizontally | Display content backwards | . Live Grading Presentation.  . On Live grading reviews each team will present to another Table/Team while the Teacher observes. Each team will have 10 minutes to go over their FRQs; or a little over 2 minutes per FRQ. . Create a Team Review and Review Ticket for all 4 FRQs with each Team Member participating in the discussion. | Record presentations and make a highlight clip 30 seconds to 1 minute on each of the FRQs. There will be a live review to go over final review ticket and clips. | . Presentation. Introduce ‘FRQ lesson’ and introduce how you plan to present the Material(s). . Have parts that each person will go over. | Consider an activity or illustration other than Code/Code/Coding to learn about each FRQ. | Outside sources can be used to complement the lesson: College Board, Khan Academy, etc | It would be interesting if you adapt FRQs, so that they work together. This would show your ability to plan and produce something useful. | . Live Review requirements . If code is not given by College Board you must complete it, your FRQs must run. | Jupyter Notebooks contain comments and markdown cells that describe work, in this case it should be easy to understand FRQ, purpose, and funciton. | Show grades and blog(s)/comments used during reviews. | Java output of cells in Jupyter Notebook is required when posting. | .",

Many of the JavaScript cells will use the output tag(s) to write into the HTML that has been setup. . %%html is used to setup HTML code block | “style” tag enables visuals customization | “div” tag is setup to receive data | . %%html &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;style&gt; #output { background-color: #353b45; padding: 10px; border: 3px solid #ccc; } &lt;/style&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;data&quot; hidden&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;output&quot;&gt; Hello! &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; . other outputs explored . There are several ways to ouput the classic introduction message: “Hello, World!” . Before you go further, open Console on your Browser. JavaScript developer leaves Console open all the time!!! | The function console.log() outputs to Console, this is often used for inspection or debugging. | “Hello, World” is a String literal. This is the referred to as Static text, as it does not change. Developer call this a hard coded string. | &quot;Hello, World&quot; literal is a parameter to console.log(), element.txt() and alert(). | The element.textContent is part of Jupyter Notebook %%js magic. This is convenient for Notebook and testing. | The alert command outputs the parameter to a dialog box, so you can see it in this Jupyter notebook. The alert commands are shown, but are commented out as the stop run all execution of the notebook. | Note, in a Web Application Debugging: An alert is often used for less savy Developers. Console is used by more savy developers; console often requires setting up a lot of outputs. Source level debugging is the most powerful solution for debugging and does not require alert or console commands. | . %%js // required to allow cell to be JavaScript enabled console.log(&quot;JavaScript/Jupyter Output Intro&quot;); // Browser Console output; debugging or tracing console.log(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); // Set element in HTML above using DOM (Document Object Model) document.getElementById(&quot;output&quot;).textContent = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;; // Jupyter built in magic element for testing and convenience of development element.textContent = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;; // element is an output option as part of %%js magic //alert(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); . multiple outputs using one variable . This second example is a new sequence of code, two or more lines of code forms a sequence. This example defines a variable, thank goodness!!! In the previous example we were typing the string &quot;Hello, World&quot; over and over. Observe with the variable msg=&quot;Hello, World!&quot;; we type the string once and now use msg over and over. . The variable “var msg =” is used to capture the data | The console.log(msg) outputs to console, be sure to Inspect it! | The element.text() is part of Jupyter Notebooks and displays as output blow the code on this page. Until we build up some more interesting data for Web Site, we will not use be using the Python HTML, CSS technique. | The alert(msg) works the same as previous, but as the other commands uses msg as parameter. | . %%js console.log(&quot;Variable Definition&quot;); var msg = &quot;Hello, World Again!&quot;; // Use msg to output code to Console and Jupyter Notebook console.log(msg); //right click browser select Inspect, then select Console to view document.getElementById(&quot;output&quot;).textContent = msg; element.append(msg); //alert(msg); . output showing use of a function . This example passes the defined variable “msg” to the newly defined “function logIt(output)”. . There are multiple steps in this code.. The “definition of the function”: “function logIt(output) {}” and everything between curly braces is the definitions of the function. Passing a parameter is required when you call this function. | The “call to the function:”logIt(msg)” is the call to the function, this actually runs the function. The variable “msg” is used a parameter when calling the logIt function. | . | Showing reuse of function… There are two calls to the logIt function | This is called Prodedural Abstraction, a term that means reusing the same code | . | . %%js console.log(&quot;Function Definition&quot;); /* Function: logIt * Parameter: output * Description: The parameter is &quot;output&quot; to console and jupyter page */ function logIt(msg) { console.log(msg); element.append(msg); document.getElementById(&quot;output&quot;).textContent = msg; //alert(output); } // sequence of code build logIt parameter using concatenation var msg = &quot;Hello, Students!&quot; // replaces content of variable var classOf = &quot;Welcome CS class of 2023-2024.&quot; logIt(msg + &quot; &quot; + classOf); // concatenation of strings . output showing Loosely typed data . JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning you don’t have to specify what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. . To define a variable you prefix the name with var or const. The variable type is determined by JavaScript at runtime. | Python and many interpretive languages are loosely typed like JavaScript. This is considered programmer friendly. | Java which is a compiled language is strongly typed, thus you will see terms like String, Integer, Double, and Object in the source code. | In JavaScript, the typeof keyword returns the type of the variable. Become familiar with type as it is valuable in conversation and knowing type help you understand how to modify data. Each variable type will have built in methods to manage content within the data type. | . %%js console.log(&quot;Examine Data Types&quot;); // Function to add typeof to output function getType(output) { return typeof output + &quot;: &quot; + output; } // Function defintion function logIt(msg) { console.log(getType(msg)); // logs string console.info(msg); // logs object document.getElementById(&quot;output&quot;).textContent = msg; element.append(getType(msg) + &quot; &quot;); // adds to Jupyter output //alert(getType(msg)); } // Common Types element.append(&quot;Common Types &quot;); logIt(&quot;Mr M&quot;); // String logIt(1997); // Number logIt(true); // Boolean // Object Type, this definition is often called a array or list element.append(&quot;Object Type, array &quot;); var scores = [ 90, 80, 100 ]; logIt(scores); // Complex Object, this definition is often called hash, map, hashmap, or dictionary element.append(&quot;Object Type, hash or dictionary &quot;); var person = { // key:value pairs seperated by comma &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;role&quot;: &quot;Teacher&quot; }; logIt(person); logIt(JSON.stringify(person)); //method used to convert this object into readable format . Build a Person object, JSON, and show output . JavaScript and other languages have special properties and syntax to store and represent data. In fact, a class in JavaScript is a special function. . Definition of class allows for a collection of data, the “class Person” allows programmer to retain name, github id, and class of a Person. | Instance of a class, the “const teacher = new Person(“Mr M”, “jm1021”, 1977)” makes an object “teacher” which is an object representation of “class Person”. | Setting and Getting properties After creating teacher and student objects, observe that properties can be changed/muted or extracted/accessed. | . %%js console.log(&quot;Person objects&quot;); /* class: Person * Description: A collection of Person data */ class Person { /* method: constructor * parameters: name, ghID - GitHub ID, classOf - Graduation Class * description: returns object when &quot;new Person()&quot; is called with matching parameters * assignment: this.name, this.ghID, ... are properties retained in the returned object * default: role uses a default property, it is set to &quot;Student&quot; */ constructor(name, ghID, classOf, role=&quot;Student&quot;) { this.name = name; this.ghID = ghID; this.classOf = classOf; this.role = role; } /* method: setter * parameters: role - role in classroom * description: this.role is updated from default value to value contained in role parameter */ setRole(role) { this.role = role; } /* method: getter * description: turns properties of object into JSON object * return value: JSON object */ getJSON() { const obj = {type: typeof this, name: this.name, ghID: this.ghID, classOf: this.classOf, role: this.role}; const json = JSON.stringify(obj); return json; } /* method: logIT * description: this Person object is logged to console */ logIt() { //Person Object console.info(this); // HTML output document.getElementById(&quot;output&quot;).textContent = this.getJSON(); //Log to Jupter element.append(this.role + &quot; object in JSON: &quot;); element.append(this.getJSON()); element.append(&quot; &quot;); //alert(this.getJSON()); } } // make a new Person Object const teacher = new Person(&quot;Mr M&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977); // object type is easy to work with in JavaScript // update role to Teacher var role = &quot;Teacher&quot;; teacher.setRole(role); // set the role teacher.logIt(); // log to console // make a new Person Object const student = new Person(&quot;Jane Doe&quot;, &quot;jane&quot;, 2007); // object type is easy to work with in JavaScript student.logIt(); // log to console .

This code extracts JSON text from HTML, that was placed in DOM in a previous JavaScript cell, then it parses text into a JavaScript object. In addition, there is a for loop that iterates over the extracted object generating formated rows and columns in an HTML table. .

In Python, we use variables to store data, each are given a type at assignment. Variables have names, types, and data. Python variables can be of type: String, Integer, Float, List and Dictionary. The types are important to understand and will impact coding operations, for instance we are required to use str() function in concatenation of different data types. A type of List allows developer to perform iteration. . Developers often think of variables as primitives or collections. Look at this example and see if you can see hypothesize the difference between a primitive and a collection. | Take a minute and see if you can reference other elements in the list or other keys in the dictionary.

List and Dictionary purpose . Our society is being built on information. List and Dictionaries are used to collect information. Mostly, when information is collected it is formed into patterns. As that pattern is established you will be able collect many instances of that pattern. . A List is used to collect many instances of a pattern | A Dictionary is used to organize data patterns. | Iteration is often used to process through lists. | . To start exploring more deeply into List, Dictionary and Iteration this example will explore constructing a List of people and cars. . As we learned above, a List is a data type: class ‘list’ | A &#39;list&#39; data type has the method &#39;.append(expression)&#39; that allows you to add to the list. A class usually has extra methods to support working with its objects. | In the example below, the expression is appended to the ‘list’ is the data type: class ‘dict’ | At the end, you see a fairly complicated data structure. This is a list of dictionaries, or a collection of many similar data patterns. The output looks similar to JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), Jekyll/GitHub pages yml files, FastPages Front Matter.

Formatted output of List/Dictionary - for loop . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet, to applications, or preparing it to be stored into a database. It is a great way to exchange data between programs and programmers. Exchange of data between programs includes the data type the method/function and the format of the data type. These concepts are key to learning how to write functions, receive, and return data. This process is often referred to as an Application Programming Interface (API). . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process… . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called “d_rec” short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. | Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. | Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. | . # This jupyter cell has dependencies on one or more cells above # print function: given a dictionary of InfoDb content def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Residence:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Residence&quot;]) # t is a tab indent print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Birth Day:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Cars: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) # end=&quot;&quot; make sure no return occurs print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Owns_Cars&quot;])) # join allows printing a string list with separator print() # for loop algorithm iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) # call to function for_loop() # call to function . Alternate methods for iteration - while loop . In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a “while” loop and “recursion”. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, “while i &lt; len(InfoDb):”. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() | . # This jupyter cell has dependencies on one or more cells above # while loop algorithm contains an initial n and an index incrementing statement (n += 1) def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return while_loop() . Calling a function repeatedly - recursion . This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with “recursive_loop(0)” | the last statement indented inside the if statement “recursive_loop(i + 1)” activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing | ultimately the “if i &lt; len(InfoDb):” will evaluate to false and the program ends | . # This jupyter cell has dependencies on one or more cells above # recursion algorithm loops incrementing on each call (n + 1) until exit condition is met def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) .

README.md: This file contains instructions for setting up the necessary tools and cloning the project. A README file is a standard component of all properly set up GitHub projects. . | requirements.txt: This file lists the dependencies required to turn this Python project into a Flask/Python project. It may also include other backend dependencies, such as dependencies for working with a database. . | main.py: This Python source file is used to run the project. Running this file starts a Flask web server locally on localhost. During development, this is the file you use to run, test, and debug the project. . | Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml: These files are used to run and test the project in a Docker container. They allow you to simulate the project’s deployment on a server, such as an AWS EC2 instance. Running these files helps ensure that your tools and dependencies work correctly on different machines. . | instances: This directory is the standard location for storing data files that you want to remain on the server. For example, SQLite database files can be stored in this directory. Files stored in this location will persist after web application restart, everyting outside of instances will be recreated at restart. . | static: This directory is the standard location for files that you want to be cached by the web server. It is typically used for image files (JPEG, PNG, etc.) or JavaScript files that remain constant during the execution of the web server. . | api: This directory contains code that receives and responds to requests from external servers. It serves as the interface between the external world and the logic and code in the rest of the project. . | model: This directory contains files that implement the backend functionality for many of the files in the api directory. For example, there may be files in the model directory that directly interact with the database. . | templates: This directory contains files and subdirectories used to support the home and error pages of the website. . | .gitignore: This file specifies elements to be excluded from version control. Files are excluded when they are derived and not considered part of the project’s original source. In the VSCode Explorer, you may notice some files appearing dimmed, indicating that they are intentionally excluded from version control based on the rules defined in .gitignore. . | .

            "title": "P4 Iteration",
            "content": "Team Tech Talk: Iteration . Group members: Marcus, Hao, Ameer, Kayden . What is Iteration? In coding, &quot;iteration&quot; means to repetitively perform a set of actions or operations, typically with the purpose of processing or examining a collection of items, such as a list, array, or other data structures. It is a fundamental concept in programming and is often used when you need to perform a specific task multiple times or when you want to process a collection of data, such as a list or an array. Below is an example of an iteration, and its uses. python for number in range(5): print(number) 0 1 2 3 4 for &quot;number&quot; in range(5): - This line initiates a for loop. The loop variable &quot;number&quot; is used to iterate through a sequence of numbers generated by the range(5) function. range(5) generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 4, which means the loop will run 5 times. print(number) - Inside the loop, this line prints the value of the loop variable &quot;number&quot; to the console. Since &quot;number&quot; takes on the values from the range(5) sequence, it will print the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 in separate lines. You can also create an iteration using words or a list. Examples below. python fruits = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;cherry&quot;, &quot;date&quot;, &quot;fig&quot;] for fruit in fruits: for number in range(3): print(fruit) apple apple apple banana banana banana cherry cherry cherry date date date fig fig fig In this example, the input was a list of fruits, which is then put into the code where the fruits will be printed and repeated 3 times, because of the iteration of &quot;for number in range(3)&quot; keyword &quot;range(3)&quot; Popcorn Hack #1 now create your own iteration, wheter that be a list of numbers or words, its up to you. (3 minutes) Indefinite Iteration Indefinite iteration, also known as conditional or while-loop iteration, involves repeating a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true. Unlike definite iteration, where you know the exact number of iterations in advance, with indefinite iteration, the loop continues as long as the condition is met. If the condition becomes false at any point, the loop terminates. Below is an example of the layout python while condition: # Loop body condition: This is a boolean expression. The loop will continue executing as long as this condition is True. #Loop body: This is the block of code that gets executed during each iteration. It can include one or more statements. Below is an example code of indefinite iteration: python while True: user_input = input(&quot;Enter something (type &#39;exit&#39; to quit): &quot;) if user_input == &quot;exit&quot;: break print(&quot;You entered:&quot;, user_input) We use a &quot;while True&quot; loop, which means the loop will run indefinitely until we explicitly exit it. &lt;/br&gt; Inside the loop, we ask the user for input and store it in the user_input variable. &lt;/br&gt; We checked if the user input is equal to &quot;exit.&quot; If it is, we use the break statement to exit the loop. &lt;/br&gt; If the input from the user is not &quot;exit,&quot; we print what they entered. We can see this through the code (&quot;You entered:&quot;, user_input) &lt;/br&gt; This code will keep asking for input and printing it until the user types &quot;exit,&quot; at which point the loop will terminate. Loop Control Statements Loop control statements are used to manage the flow of loops and determine when to exit, skip, or repeat iterations within a loop. There are three primary loop control statements: (Break) - Exit a Loop Prematurely: &lt;/br&gt; break is used to exit a loop when a specific condition is met. Example: Exit a loop when the number 5 is encountered. python for i in range(10): if i == 5: break print(i) 0 1 2 3 4 (Continue) - Skip the Current Iteration: &lt;/br&gt; continue is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next. Example: Skip printing the number 2 in a loop. python for i in range(5): if i == 2: continue print(i) 0 1 3 4 return (in Functions) - Exit a Function and Loop: &lt;/br&gt; In functions, return is used to exit the function and any loop within it. Example: Exit a function and loop when a target value is found. python def calculate_rectangle_area(length, width): area = length * width return area length = 5 width = 3 area = calculate_rectangle_area(length, width) print(&quot;The area of the rectangle is:&quot;, area) The area of the rectangle is: 15 Above is more of a complex iteration, but we use the return statement to specify that the result of the function is the value stored in the (area) variable. # Homework! create a code for each of the different scenarios below: a list of numbers that repeats (10 times) &lt;/br&gt; a list of words (use your creativity) &lt;/br&gt; a hack using indefinite iteration. You could ask the user for a password, number, phrase, or something that will initiate the exit. Example below. python while True: user_input = input(&quot;Enter something (type &#39;exit&#39; to quit): &quot;) if user_input == &quot;exit&quot;: break print(&quot;You entered:&quot;, user_input) | | | | | | . | | | | | . | | . | | .",

In the previous weeks, you’ve successfully set up a web server using GitHub Pages, converting Jupyter Notebooks into Markdown for a seamless online presentation. Today, we’ll take that knowledge to the next level as we dive into creating your very own web server using Flask. . Understanding Web Servers . What is a Web Server? . Traditionally, we had librarians at libraries that would help you find books or information. Today in the digital world, thousands upon thousands of home pages, search engines, and digital archives have been built using web servers. . GitHub Pages vs. Flask . You’ve already experienced a form of web server through GitHub Pages. Think of GitHub Pages as a library that has established rules for publishing Markdown notes and Jupyter Notebooks neatly on a bookshelf. . Now, let’s introduce Flask, your personal web server. Flask can create and manage any type of content, including customizing everything according to your preferences, and even serve additional information (like a database with APIs). . The Flask Framework Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It’s designed to be minimal and easy to use, making it perfect for building web applications, APIs, and, yes, even your web server. Today, we will start with the basics of Flask and see how it empowers you to create and manage web content. . Our Goals for Today . Here’s what we’ll accomplish in this session: . Create a minimal Flask server. | Explore the Python/Flask process. | Access data from our Flask server using Python. | Access data from our Flask server using JavaScript. | Learn how to stop the Python/Flask process gracefully. | .

The review will highlight elements from the sprint. . Work is performed daily in class, expectations are 2 hours of outside work weekly. A Showcase for a Sprint is where you, and in this case your pair, have progressed working on Canvas Assignments and Hacks in the time provided until you scheduled Showcase. Everything is iterative, so there is no such thing as extended time in a Sprint Showcase. Everyday you should be working and blogging to prepare for the Showcase. . Showcase Requirements . This is a culmination of all activities in a Sprint. During the Sprint there is always time to preview or communcate progress with the teacher; if you have shared progress during the sprint, be sure to highlight success to jog Teachers memory. Never, never expect the Teacher to remember something you did. The Showcase is time for you to shine and impress. . Format of Showcase. This is a pair event. This Sprint is focused on Pair Programming and Work, not Team. In a class, live reviews for this Showcase will be done in pairs or trios (rare, 3 or less per class) for this event. Make sure work is polished and reviewed. Part of working with a pair is preparation, review, and testing prior to presenting to Teacher. In the Tech world, quality presentation of Tech are as important as the Tech itself. Never share work that has not be previewed or share buggy work in a Showcase. This lacks professionalism. | Google or Microsoft Docs, Sheets, Presentations are frowned upon and will result in significant deduction. It is expected that you will be showing materials from your personal Student blog. The Teacher believes using a blog is helping with your ability to design, organize, and code. | Pair work can be shared, but both people should be able to talk about anything they expect to be counted toward their personal credit. If you did not participate or carry your load on a topic, be honest, don’t fake accomplishments. Attempts to get credit by coat tailing is frowned upon. | . | Preparation and Time. The Showcase requires preparation. At this event, it would be a mistake to ask “what do you want to see”. There are many sources that have been provided to answer that question. Sprint Illustration. Consider the outline for the sprint a a guideline of key elements expected to be in the Showcase. | Spring Blogs. The hacks within the blogs contain the majority of the requirements that should be incorporated into the materials you present in the Showcase. | . | . Ongoing Evaluations . There are many ways to perform assesments in classroom. Grade is not the only assessment that is on a report card. A Student, on a daily basis, establishes work behaviors and capabilities with a Teacher, An employee, on a daily basis, establishes work behaviors with peers and manager. We will be establishing a Data Science profile 1/0 for each student as we progress in the class, this profile will be maintained by Teacher and will be used in evaluating grade. . Focus, Intentions . Attendance: Does the student have a computer every day, were they overly tardy, or did they have any irregularities in presence; like being gone for 1/2 hour bathroom breaks, missing intro sessions to class, … . | Work Habits: Does the student have a class time work ethic or in Teacher perception appears to be productive; do they have collaboration meetings with pair and team? do they do their own work in class time? do the follow a plan? are the open to change? are the improving habits? are their work habits a positive to those around them?… . | Behavior: Does the student require redirection from Teacher to be on task? are they active and appropriately participating in Tech Talks? are they maintaining seed points? are they focussing on the right things? do they have grit and persistence? … . | Timely: Is the student ready to participate in live reviews? are they aware of assignments and due dates? is their work outcome in alignment with assignment expectation? are they on track with work and showing progress? is progress consistent with time period, expectations, and Teacher assessed capabilities? …. . | . | Technical Progression . Qualified, satisfies pre-requisites: Teacher assessment on if the Student was qualified to take class. For instance, some CSA students skip CSP and have had no previous background in CompSci. Another case, is the student a “good student”; someone that completes tasks and accomplishes goals; someone that is prepared to work in class and do homework? Finally, is the student able to identify their needs and learning style requirements; do they participate; do they ask questions; will they review visuals; talk about problems? … . | Tech sense: Teacher assesment on the “technical sense or sensibility” when entering the class and throughout the year. For instance, in the beginning is student able to navigate their own computer, locate files, install software? Or as they progress through year are they able to use their tools, perform tool updates, keep things working, troubleshoot? Are they able to navigate through technical elements? Over time, will they adapt and try to improve efficiency? … . | Clarity/Presentation: Does the student show the ability to explain what they have been working on? Are the able to describe technical elements with correct vocabulary? Are they able to understand technological jargon, understand the technical frameworks in order to explain it to others? Are they confident and prepared? … . | Tech growth: Teacher assesment on “technical rating” as student progresses in class or prepares to take the AP exam. Did the student acquire technical abilities in each Sprint prior to AP exam? Does the student learn the Tech, or do they simply try for the points? Is the student building on skills learned as foundations for the next task? At the time of the AP exam time, did the Teacher believe that they would undoubtedly receive a “3” or higher? . | . | Soft Skills, Presentation . Self advocacy: Teacher assesment and perception on how the student self advocates. Does the student effectively communicate, convey, negotiate or assert interests, desires, needs? Does the student seek out help when needed? Does the student ask questions on Slack, in person, of team members? Does the student attend Tutorial? Is the student aware and informed of assignments? Does student make informed decisions and take responsibility for their own decisions? . | Comm and Collab skills: Teacher assesment and perception on whether the student is a collaborator and communicator in classroom. Does the Teacher see the student exhibiting collaboritive behaviors? Does student explain and review work with others? Do they work consistently plan work with others? Are communication and collaboration willing and active attributes in the students behavior? Does the Teacher observe the student as active in communication during live reviews? . | Leadership: Teacher assesment or observation on leadership qualities of the student. Did the Teacher observe the student as having key leadership and organization skills? Did the Teacher see time management skills exhibited by the student, including schedule, finding the in-between time for things that are not part of the norm? Did the student exhibit networking, critical thiking, and proactivity? Did the Teacher ask the student to take on a leadership position in the classroom? Did the student follow through with that responsibiility? Would the Teacher ask the student to perform a task important to the entire classroom? . | Integrity: Teacher assesment on how the student represents their own work and behavior. Does the student have a general sense of self-awareness, group-awareness, and how actions impact others? Does the student and student group respect and follow the rules established in the classroom and by the Teacher? Without question, did the student do their own work on each assignment through the year? In live reviews, did the Teacher think the student was misrepresenting work as their own? Was there questionable behavior that was not atoned, for instance being a suspect or caught in cheating scandal? . | . | .",

Object datatype . store records as key-value pairs | are defined by enclosing data in curly braces {} | allow access and modification using dot . or square bracket [] notation | . %%js console.log(&quot;Object: assigning key-value objects&quot;) var obj = { name: &quot;Safin&quot;, age: 13 }; // The following is stored in the object called &quot;obj&quot; // { // name: &quot;Safin&quot;, // age: 13 // } // // The key &quot;name&quot; is associated with the string value &quot;Safin&quot; // The key &quot;age&quot; is associated with the number value 13 // Notice that keys are of the type &quot;string&quot; // print obj to the console console.log(obj); // -&gt; { name: &#39;Safin&#39;, age: 13 } // Notice that single quotes &#39; and double quotes &quot; can be used interchangeably . object access . %%js console.log(&quot;Object: assigning key-value objects&quot;) var obj = { name: &quot;Safin&quot;, age: 13 }; // The following is stored in the object called &quot;obj&quot; // { // name: &quot;Safin&quot;, // age: 13 // } // // The key &quot;name&quot; is associated with the string value &quot;Safin&quot; // The key &quot;age&quot; is associated with the number value 13 // Notice that keys are of the type &quot;string&quot; // print obj to the console console.log(obj); // -&gt; { name: &#39;Safin&#39;, age: 13 } // Notice that single quotes &#39; and double quotes &quot; can be used interchangeably // To access certain values within an object, also known as an object&#39;s fields, // you can use the name of the object suffixed with a dot and the name of the field // or using the square bracket notation shown below console.log(&quot;Object: using key name to access the name value (key notation)&quot;) console.log(obj[&quot;name&quot;]); console.log(&quot;Object: using key name to access the name value (dot notation)&quot;) console.log(obj.name); // -&gt; Safin // Fields of an object can be manipulated similar to variables console.log(&quot;Object: mutating the key name from Safin to John&quot;) obj.name = &quot;John&quot; console.log(obj); console.log(obj.name); // -&gt; John // A key-value pair can be added to the object console.log(&quot;Object: mutating the key name from Safin to John&quot;) obj[&quot;ghid&quot;] = &quot;jm1021&quot; console.log(obj); // Observe new key . Hacks . Create a JavaScript snippet below with the following requirements: . Create an object representing yourself as a person. The object should have keys for your name, age, current classes, interests, and two more of your choosing | Your object must contain keys whose values are arrays. The arrays can be arrays of strings, numbers, or even other objects if you would like | Print the entire object with console.log after declaring it | Manipulate the arrays within the object and print the entire object with console.log as well as the specific changed key afterwards | Perform mathematical operations on fields in your object such as +, -, /, % etc. and print the results with console.log along with a message contextualizing them | Use typeof to determine the types of at least 3 fields in your object | . %%js // put your javascript code here (make sure to run it and check your outputs in the console) . &lt;IPython.core.display.Javascript object&gt; .",

            "content": "Agile Methodology . . Agile software development uses practices such as pair programming, test-driven development, stand-ups, planning sessions, and sprints. Agile includes the 12 Principles expressed in the Manifesto for Agile Software Development. . . Roles . To ensure transparency during the sprint the Team should meet daily at the daily scrum (sometimes called a standup). As adaptation for classroom, Team should have a standup meeting for weekly plans, should have assignments for tasks, assignments for integration and deployment. . Scrum Master: The scrum master helps to facilitate the sprint by ensuring that an agile framework is followed. He/she is committed to tracking issues and maintaining scrum boards, but should also remain flexible and open to opportunities for the team to improve their workflow. | DevOps: DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an team’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: version control, integration, dependency file management (POM file, requirements.txt), AWS and GitHub deployment are some of the key functions that improve velocity. | Development Team: The development team can be comprised of all kinds of people including designers, writers, presenters, developers, etc. Two key roles in Web Development are … Frontend Developer: A front-end developer builds the front-end portion of websites and web applications—that is, the part that users actually see and interact with. | Backend Developer: Back-end developers build and maintain the mechanisms that process data and perform actions like data storage, security, and other server-side functions that are behind the scenes. | . | . Workload . When planning there is an expectation of time. . Individual in Class Time. You should expect 3 to 4 hours of productive classroom work each week. | Individual at Home Time. To maintain pace in this class, you should consider a 2 hour coding or design session (weekly) outside of class time. | Sprint Calculation Time. 5-6 hours of coding or planning per week per individual, or 20-24 hours per team. If we had a two week Sprint this would be 40-48 hours of work. | Key to success. Make great use of time in class. Pair share programming typically provides three time dividend over individual programming when you are learning something new. | . Issues . Sprint cadences have ideas/issues that are broken into short term work units called tasks. Teacher establishes Sprint time in class schedule. . Scrum Board / GitHub Project / Kanban Style . The Scrum Board contains issues that are assigned to individuals, each of these issues will have tangible deliverable links (code/video/…). Scrum Team will use Scrum Board to understand everyone’s ideas and efforts. This includes individual tasks. Use GitHub Projects add Issues to the board. Issues are placed in columns on a Scrum Board (Kanban) to represent progress. The below columns have been successful in our academic environment. . To do/backlog | In progress | Code Complete | Deployed | Verified | Sprint . Sprint is a period of time that Team uses to plan work and execute work. This includes planning, research, development, deployment, and test. Typically, sprints will be 4 weeks with shorter chekpoints in the classroom. Anytime a sprint lasts longer than a week, there needs to be weekly Review Tickets (formative assessment) and concluding with an end of Sprint Review Ticket (summative assessment). Sample sprint follows… . Week 1 Monday - Sprint Objectives, Scrum Team Planning | Tuesday - College Board Test Prep Tuesday (Student Led) | Wednesday - Code, Code, Code | Thursday - Tech Talk (Teacher) | Friday - Code, Code, Code; Teacher 1 v 2, formative review | 2 hours outside of class for project work | . | . … . Week 4 Monday - Sprint Crossover Grading, Scrum Team Planning | Tuesday - College Board Testing | Wednesday - Code, Code, Code | Thursday - Tech Talk (Teacher) | Friday - Code, Code, Code; Teacher 1 v 4 including Demos/Review Ticket/Peer, summative review | 2 hours outside of class for project work | . | . 7 Important Transferable Skills . Assessments / Reviews . During Teacher reviews meetings ( 1 v 2 pair, 1 v 4 team), the pair or team will provide Teacher with an Issues that that will be called a Review Ticket. The issue will be completed, it will reference Tasks Completed and Self/Crossover Score(s). Canvas should be used as a guide to completing a review ticket, make sure you account for everything. Make sure Point total is a the top of ticket, if points are important to you! All assessments will be looking for these 7 elements in your work… . Creativity Creativity doesn’t necessarily mean you paint or draw or sculpt well. Creativity in education and workplace, in many cases, presents itself in terms of how you approach tasks and solve problems, Do you both inside and outside of the box for solutions? Or, do you stick to a planned system? If you solve even the smallest problem, you’ve demonstrated creativity. This skill scales up: Big problems are enlarged small problems; small problems scaled are big problems. Conceptualize problems and solutions | Display foresight | Make connections | Make intelligent inferences | Synthesize ideas and data | . | Critical thinking Solving complex or abstract problems requires critical thinking, especially when the problems are critical. Not only that, but critical thinking skills also enable the discovery of deficiencies that could cause less than optimal results. The ability to take a step back and look at things more critically and say ‘Where might we have to have gotten this wrong?’ or ‘How might we be able to improve this?’ is critical thinking. IIf you can articulate this skill you will stand out! | Critical thinkers head off problems before they arise. And if they do surface, they take them head-on. | . | Communication Effective communication is the crux of everything you do.. It doesn’t matter how creative or intelligent you are, or how many computer languages you know: If you can’t communicate well, your other skills are meaningless. Students are encouraged to talk about how they were able to bring their teams together. Verbal skills. How do you address an audience in terms they can understand. | Listening skills. Learning and understanding without defensiveness. | Writing skills. You need to be able to write in such a way that non-experts will understand. | Technological communication skills. You should be able to discuss highly technical hard skills in a way appropriate to your audience. Communication details are not the same for all audiences. | . | Collaboration through Leadership Leadership skills generally encompass communication, problem-solving and managing conflict, relationship building and being able to get people on your team on board with a mission or project. Leaders are big-picture thinkers who take various interests into account when making major decisions. Leaders are responsible for: Delegating responsibility | Demonstrating effective time management | Initiating new ideas | Major decision-making | Managing conflict | Managing groups | Multitasking | Teaching and mentoring | . | Collaboration through Teamwork Individuals that work well with others. This is a important category mentioned in early school. But it applies to High School, College and adults. Trust is the major difference between working alone versus working in groups. And trust can be hard: Some people are skeptical by nature or want to work through an entire project lifecycle solo. But placing trust in an active, dynamic team provides more than just project completion. Teamwork — a sense of community — elevates spirits and improves productivity. Accepting responsibility | Making and implementing decisions | Managing time wisely | Meeting both short- and long-term goals | Organizing | Setting and meeting deadlines | . | Researching Research is not a process performed by Teacher, Boss, or some upstream process. Everything you do in Technology requires research. Research is a key part of the lifecycle: changing plans, fluctuating results, and roadblocks require research before anyone can take action. Conversing with team members is a form of research: If you’ve asked a peer’s opinion on a technical matter, you’ve performed research. Analyzing information | Brainstorming solutions | Delineating needs and requirements | Extracting information from data | Gathering information | Forecasting possible roadblocks | Setting goals | Solving problems | . | Technical Ability We live in a tech-heavy world, and you need to understand the tech your project requires. Try to stay current with the many technical advancements on your project. Make sure that you play with the different softwares and platforms that are part of your environment. Be knowledgeable and speak to the technical things that you are learning. Being easy to work with | Quick to learn | Glad to learn | Failing and always willing to try new things | Willing to open new doors in case of a drastic oversight | . | Hacks .

Simply add a &lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt; in your markdown or jupyter cells | (Note: the %%html magic command allows us to add HTML and JavaScript into a jupyter notebook, the outputted “site” will be shown below the code) | . %%html &lt;h3&gt;Page Heading&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Paragraph description of page&lt;/p&gt; &lt;script&gt; console.log(&quot;Output to console, showing that JavaScript code is running&quot;) &lt;/script&gt; . Page Heading . Paragraph description of page . Writing text to console.log . The text written with console.log appears in the Console | console.log allows you to write text – but you don’t see any text in above example until you view Console. | Activate Console window VSCode Help-Toggle Developer Tools allows you to see console.log output | Chrome and other browsers require right click -&gt; inspect also allows access to console.log output Safari users will need to enable developer settings before inspecting an element. To do this go to Safari settings -&gt; advanced and check the box next to “Show develop menu in menu bar” | . | By default you usually need to click Console next to Elements, to see console.log output | Also, you may want to press clear console (cirlcl with slash) to clean up screen before analysis. | . | . Try code with Console . Developers typically keep console open | In console window, you can run javascript code from prompt | . Storing data . One of the most important things in programming is learning how data is stored, this is often called Data Abstraction (the ability to represent data in a programming language). | . Types of data . Javascript has a few basic types of data, which align with what the types of data you might know yourself | In javascript, these types are formalized as: text = “string”, number = “number”, true/false = “boolean” | . | . Name the Data . When you think of data, it has a name and a value. | Using the “var” JavaScript syntax you create a variable with a name and a value. | In javascript this can represented with the following: var someName = value; The name cannot have spaces | Text values must be wrapped in single or double quotes to identify it as text (see exmaples below) | . | . Accessing data . To access data (the value of a variable), simply just use the name of the variable | For example, we can use the values from previously in a console.log | . %%html &lt;script&gt; // create variables var firstName = &quot;Rohan&quot; var lastName = &#39;Juneja&#39; var age = 17; var isSchoolDay = true; // inspect values and type console.log(firstName, typeof firstName) console.log(lastName, typeof lastName) console.log(age, typeof age) console.log(isSchoolDay, typeof isSchoolDay) &lt;/script&gt; . String Operators . ”+” concatenates string, same as combining text | ”==” checks if strings are the same, if so it outputs true, otherwise false ”!==” is “not equal to” (opposite of equal to) | . | . Assignment Operator . ”=” can be used to change the value of a variable ie. if you already created “name1” you can reassign name1 = “New Name” | . | . %%html &lt;script&gt; // string assignment var name1 = &quot;Doe&quot; var name2 = &quot;Doe&quot; // compare names console.log(&quot;String Comparison&quot;) console.log(&quot;name1&quot;, name1) console.log(&quot;name2&quot;, name2) console.log(&quot;name1 == name2&quot;, name1 == name2) // changing the value of name1 and repeat compare console.log(&quot;String Comparison after change&quot;) name1 = &quot;John&quot; // reassign console.log(&quot;name1&quot;, name1) console.log(&quot;name2&quot;, name2) console.log(&quot;name1 == name2&quot;, name1 == name2) console.log(&quot;String Concatenation&quot;) console.log(name1 + &quot; &quot; + name2) &lt;/script&gt; . Number Operators . ”+” adds numbers together | ”-“ subtracts numbers, “/” divides numbers, “*” multiples numbers | ”===” checks if two values are the same, if so it outputs true, otherwise false ”!==” is “not equal to” (opposite of equal to) | normal oeprators like “&lt;”, “&gt;”, “&gt;=” (greater than or equal to), “&lt;=” with numbers | . | . Assignment Operator . ”=” can be used to create or change the value of a variable | . %%html &lt;script&gt; var age1 = 17 var age2 = 16 var age3 = &#39;17&#39; console.log(&quot;Number Comparisons&quot;) console.log(&quot;age1:&quot;, age1) console.log(&quot;age2:&quot;, age2) console.log(&quot;age3:&quot;, age3) console.log(&quot;age1 == age2&quot;, age1 == age2) console.log(&quot;age1 == age3&quot;, age1 == age3) console.log(&quot;age1 === age3&quot;, age1 === age3) console.log(&quot;age1 &gt; age2&quot;, age1 &gt; age2) console.log(&quot;age1 &lt; age2&quot;, age1 &lt; age2) var num1 = 9 var num2 = 5 console.log(&quot; n&quot;) console.log(&quot;Arithmetic Operations&quot;) console.log(&quot;num1:&quot;, num1) console.log(&quot;num2:&quot;, num2) console.log(&quot;num1 + num2&quot;, num1 + num2) console.log(&quot;num1 - num2&quot;, num1 - num2) console.log(&quot;num1 * num2&quot;, num1 * num2) console.log(&quot;num1 / num2&quot;, num1 / num2) console.log(&quot;num1 % num2&quot;, num1 % num2) &lt;/script&gt; . Conditional Statements . Think about any actions that you take: you usually take them based on information you take in If tommorow is a school day, set an alarm for tomorrow at 8am | . | We can also add additional clauses at the end If tommorow is a school day, set an alarm for tomorrow at 8am, otherwise (else) set an alarm for tommorow at 10am | . | . %%html &lt;script&gt; // the above example in code console.log(&quot;Alarm Example&quot;) var tommorowIsSchoolDay = false if (tommorowIsSchoolDay) { // this code runs if tommorw is a school day console.log(&quot;Setting alarm for 8am&quot;) } else { // this code runs if tommorow is not a school day console.log(&quot;Setting alarm for 10am&quot;) } &lt;/script&gt; . Conditional Statements + Operators . Since many operators return a true/false value (equals, gerater than, etc.) we can use them inside “if” statements | . %%html &lt;script&gt; console.log(&quot;If statements + Operators&quot;) var age1 = 17 var age2 = 37 if (age1 &gt; age2) { // runs if age1 is more than age2 console.log(&quot;age1 is more than age2&quot;) } else if (age1 == age2) { // runs if age1 and age2 are the same console.log(&quot;age1 is the same as age2&quot;) // (age1 &lt; age2) } else { // runs if age2 is more than age1 console.log(&quot;age1 is less than age2&quot;) } &lt;/script&gt; . Hacks . Write a JavaScript program that compares two variables, a and b. Log “a is greater” if a is greater than b, “b is greater” if b is greater than a, and “both are equal” if a and b are equal. Make sure to use if statements and console.log | . %%js // put your javascript code here . &lt;IPython.core.display.Javascript object&gt; .",

With all of this in place, we can spin up the development container inside VS Code. Then, from the VS Code terminal in our Docker container environment, we can run docker-compose up in the root of our project. This will start up our individual service containers on the host machine. But, thanks to the shared network and volumes, we can continue to edit code in our development container and see the changes immediately show up on our services! . It’s also possible to use the Docker CLI to shut down or restart services as needed in development. You can even open another VS Code window and use the Remote-Containers extension to connect to one of the running service containers to directly inspect logs, edit code within that constrained environment, etc. This is a generic setup that can work for any project.

            "content": "Networking . a network is essentially a bunch of computer or internet devices that are connected with wires so they can communicate . . This network, however, will take a long time to have A comunicate with G. So a network that will work faster is shown below. There are different benefits to each as well, the first one takes less resources, but if one of the wires breaks, the whole comunication fails. But wih the second one, it takes a lot of resources, but if one wire fails, the comunication will still work. This second network in this case is fault tolerent. . . popcorn hack 1 . Is this network fault tolerent? If not, how can you make this network fault tolerant? . . Redundancy . The Internet is fault tolerant and has been made to withstand errors or problems that may occur. It does this by using redundancy. Redundancy is the inclusion of extra components in order to mitigate the failure of one part of the system. One method of to achieve this is having multiple paths between connected devices allowing transfers to have alternative routes. If a route fails the data will be sent down a different path. Fault tolerance allows users to use a network even if there are system failures. One example where redundancy wasn’t present was the backend during the night at the museum. The pathway to transfer data likely broke, and there was no redundancy to allow for an alternative path. . Popcorn Hack #2 . What would make this network fault-tolerant. . . What is Computing? . In simple terms: Computing is the use or operation of computers. To elaborate, computing includes designing and building hardware and software systems for a wide range of purposes: processing structuring, and managing various kinds of information, doing scientific studies using computers, making computer systems behave intelligently, creating and using communications and entertainment media, finding and gathering information relevant to any particular purpose, and so on. . College Board Essential Knowlege . Sequential compututing is a computational model where operations are performed one at a time in a specific order. This method is very easy to manage and implement, but it can be very slow and recorce intesive. | Parallel computing is a computational model where the program is broken into multiple smaller parts, so some of them can be computed simaltaneously. This method of computing has alot more risks, and is more difficult to manage, however it is much faster than sequential computing. | Distributed compututing is another computational model where multiple devices are used to run program. This can increase computing power, while not comsoming many resorces. | Efficiency of of models can be determined by the time they take to complete a task | . Sequential Computing . The computer works on one task at a time. Reasons for this could be old or bad harware (fewer CPUs) | Each task is dependant on the tast before it. | Execution time equals the sum of time it take for each of the individual tasks to run | Think of Sequential Computing like computing items one at a time on a conveyer belt. | . Parallel Computing . Parallel computing schedules tasks to run at the same time | Normaly all done on a single computer | Contains a Sequential portion along with a Parallel portion. | Intensive on resorces, so requires more advanced and newer hardware | Usualy much faster than sequential, and can scale alot easier. | Execution time equals the length of the longest task. | . Distibuted Computing . Sending tasks to other computors to reduce load | Is a mix of sequential and parallel computing | Requires a network to send tasks | Can take a longer amount of time, based on network and waiting for responces from other computers | . Popcorn Hack #3: Sequential, Parallel, or Distributed? . A small business collects data from daily opperations, such as sales, transactions and customer feedback. The owner watch to perform monthly data analysis for his business. What form of computing would best to handle this situation? . | A company wants to run a web search engine that will recive and process user requests from a data base. . | A meteorological institute wants to run a high resolution weather solution to predict weather patterns in real time.

In Python, this is a print statement. . The command or function is print() | “Hello, World” is a String literal. This is the referred to as Static text, as it does not change. | “Hello, World” is a parameter to the print function in Python. | The print command outputs the parameter to the terminal, as you see it in this Jupyter document | Output in Jupyter Notebook is below the code cell. Output will vary depending on tools and development intentions.

Dynamic example showing variables, input and output . This second example is a sequence of code, two or more lines forms a sequence. This example takes input from the user and stores the input into a variable called msg (short for message), then outputs the msg to terminal. - This example is Dynamic as the input and output can change each time the code is run. . A variable “msg” is part of both statement The variable “msg” is used to capture the input command | The variable “msg” is then used as a parameter to print command, causing input to be output to terminal, or in Jupyter Notebook below the code cell. | . | The “input” command activates the jupyter notebook input box, which obtains input from the user (try it!) the “msg” variable is the dynamic result of the input command | . | The print command outputs the “msg” variable captured in the input statement note, msg is a parameter to the print function | . | Input and Output in Jupyter Notebook Input is NOT in line with Output, this is a little annoyance and requires familiarity.

Python print typically obtains input and outputs to a terminal, students will see that when they run Python programs using Visual Studio Code. | . msg = input(&quot;Enter a greeting: &quot;) print(msg) . Building a Function . This example adds to the basics of the Python anatomy, a function. Input, output, and grouping commands in functions is the key to most programming languages. This example simulates a free response answer to a question. . The “def question_and_answer(prompt)” now contains multiple indented commands, the commands print and input were learned previously. | Grouping a sequence of commands, often used repeatedly, is called procedural abstraction. | Procedure, Function, def are all synonyms in the Python language. | The &quot;def&quot; is a key word in Python that defines a function. Using this keyword defines a group of commands, but does not run them initially. | The name of the function in this example is “question_and_answer”. In essence, we are defining our own command within the Python language. | The three “question_and_answer” commands that follow the function and indented commands allow this function to be run. | This code of the function is then run multiple times, each command line providing a unique “prompt” as a result of the literal parameter passed to the function. | The function takes a parameter called “prompt”, which is a message output to the user to describe the input requested. | String concatenation “+” prefixes the prompt with the literal message “Question: “. | The “msg” variable is captured as a result of the jupyter notebook input supplied by the user | The input “msg” is output back to the user with “Answer: “ concatenated to the front. | . def question_and_answer(prompt): print(&quot;Question: &quot; + prompt) msg = input() print(&quot;Answer: &quot; + msg) question_and_answer(&quot;Name the Python output command mentioned in this lesson?&quot;) question_and_answer(&quot;If you see many lines of code in order, what would College Board call it?&quot;) question_and_answer(&quot;Describe a keyword used in Python to define a function?&quot;) . Imports, Selection, and Logical Expressions . In Python anatomy of you will be importing libraries and functions. This is code that is developed by others. In this example we are importing from a library called “os”, this library extracts properties from the operating system of your existing system. Additionally, this example uses the custom function defined earlier in the Jupyter document. Python and Jupyter docs requires you to reference imports and definitions above the referencing line of code. . import os, sys obtain functions and variables from running environment | print(‘Hello, ‘ + getpass.getuser() + “ running “ + sys.executable + “ on “ + sys.platform + “!”), is a concatenated statement that outputs properties from the import | . Next, this example defines a new function “question_with_response”, this function returns a value input by the user. This allows programmer to evaluate the response. The purpose of obtaining the return value is to evaluate if correct response was given to the question. . response from “question_with_response” is captured in a variable called “rsp” return command in function returns msg input by user | assignment to “rsp” is allowed a function is returning a value, names do not need to match (but could) | . | if command is next command in sequence after “rsp” assignment this command contains an expression, rsp == “import” which compare what is typed to the string literal answer | an if expression is evaluated for true or false | true takes branch of code directly under if | false takes branch of code directly under else command | . | . The grand finally of this example is calculating the right/total. . question = 3 is defined as number of questions | correct = 0 is defined as running score | correct += 1 is the way to add one to the score, this code is placed in sequence under correct expression evaluation | since question and correct are numbers, versus strings, to place them in concatenation in print statements you must inclose them in Python function str() which turns number into string. | final print statement is concatenated and formatted to give user and right over wrong | . import getpass, sys def question_with_response(prompt): print(&quot;Question: &quot; + prompt) msg = input() return msg questions = 3 correct = 0 print(&#39;Hello, &#39; + getpass.getuser() + &quot; running &quot; + sys.executable) print(&quot;You will be asked &quot; + str(questions) + &quot; questions.&quot;) question_and_answer(&quot;Are you ready to take a test?&quot;) rsp = question_with_response(&quot;What command is used to include other functions that were previously developed?&quot;) if rsp == &quot;import&quot;: print(rsp + &quot; is correct!&quot;) correct += 1 else: print(rsp + &quot; is incorrect!&quot;) rsp = question_with_response(&quot;What command is used to evaluate correct or incorrect response in this example?&quot;) if rsp == &quot;if&quot;: print(rsp + &quot; is correct!&quot;) correct += 1 else: print(rsp + &quot; is incorrect!&quot;) rsp = question_with_response(&quot;Each &#39;if&#39; command contains an &#39;_________&#39; to determine a true or false condition?&quot;) if rsp == &quot;expression&quot;: print(rsp + &quot; is correct!&quot;) correct += 1 else: print(rsp + &quot; is incorrect!&quot;) print(getpass.getuser() + &quot; you scored &quot; + str(correct) +&quot;/&quot; + str(questions)) .

            "title": "Linux Shell and Bash",
            "content": "Bash Tutorial . A brief overview of Bash, on your way to becoming a Linux expert. When a computer boots up, a kernel (MacOS, Windows, Linux) is started. This kernel provides a shell, or terminal, that allows user to interact with a most basic set of commands. Typically, the casual user will not interact with the shell/terminal as a Desktop User Interface is started by the computer boot up process. To activate a shell directly, users will run a “terminal” through the Desktop. VS Code provides ability to activate &quot;terminal&quot; while in the IDE. . Variable Prerequisites . Setup bash shell dependency variables for this page. Variables are one of the first aspects of programming. Variables have &quot;name&quot; and a &quot;value&quot;. . Hack Note: Change variables to match your student project. | . Define variable . The following code cell defines 3 variables and assigns each a value. There are some extra command, called a HERE document, that write these variables to a file. This is so we can use these variables over and over below. . %%script bash # Dependency Variables, set to match your project directories cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt; /tmp/variables.sh export project_dir=$HOME/vscode # change vscode to different name to test git clone export project= $project_dir/teacher # change teacher to name of project from git clone export project_repo=&quot;https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/teacher.git&quot; # change to project of choice EOF . Output the value of a variable . The following code cell outputs the value of the variables, using the echo command. For visual understanding in the output, each echo command provide a title before the $variable . %%script bash # Extract saved variables source /tmp/variables.sh # Output shown title and value variables echo &quot;Project dir: $project_dir&quot; echo &quot;Project: $project&quot; echo &quot;Repo: $project_repo&quot; . Project Setup and Analysis with Bash Scripts . The bash scripts that follow automate what was done in the setup procedures. The purpose of this is to show that many of the commands we performed can be added to a script, then performed automatically. . Pull Code . Pull code from GitHub to your machine. This is a bash script, a sequence of commands, that will create a project directory and add the “project” from GitHub to the vscode directory. There is conditional logic to make sure that clone only happen if it does not (!) exist. Here are some key elements in this code… . cd command (change directory), remember this from terminal session | if statements (conditional statement, called selection statement by College Board), code inside only happens if condition is met | . %%script bash # Extract saved variables source /tmp/variables.sh echo &quot;Using conditional statement to create a project directory and project&quot; cd ~ # start in home directory # Conditional block to make a project directory if [ ! -d $project_dir ] then echo &quot;Directory $project_dir does not exists... makinng directory $project_dir&quot; mkdir -p $project_dir fi echo &quot;Directory $project_dir exists.&quot; # Conditional block to git clone a project from project_repo if [ ! -d $project ] then echo &quot;Directory $project does not exists... cloning $project_repo&quot; cd $project_dir git clone $project_repo cd ~ fi echo &quot;Directory $project exists.&quot; . Look at files Github project . All computers contain files and directories. The clone brought more files from cloud to your machine. Review the bash shell script, observe the commands that show and interact with files and directories. These were used during setup. . “ls” lists computer files in Unix and Unix-like operating systems | “cd” offers way to navigate and change working directory | “pwd” print working directory | “echo” used to display line of text/string that are passed as an argument | . %%script bash # Extract saved variables source /tmp/variables.sh echo &quot;Navigate to project, then navigate to area wwhere files were cloned&quot; cd $project pwd echo &quot;&quot; echo &quot;list top level or root of files with project pulled from github&quot; ls . Look at file list with hidden and long attributes . Most linux commands have options to enhance behavior. The enhanced listing below shows permission bits, owner of file, size and date. . ls reference . %%script bash # Extract saved variables source /tmp/variables.sh echo &quot;Navigate to project, then navigate to area wwhere files were cloned&quot; cd $project pwd echo &quot;&quot; echo &quot;list all files in long format&quot; ls -al # all files -a (hidden) in -l long listing . %%script bash # Extract saved variables source /tmp/variables.sh echo &quot;Look for posts&quot; export posts=$project/_posts # _posts inside project cd $posts # this should exist per fastpages pwd # present working directory ls -l # list posts . %%script bash # Extract saved variables source /tmp/variables.sh echo &quot;Look for notebooks&quot; export notebooks=$project/_notebooks # _notebooks is inside project cd $notebooks # this should exist per fastpages pwd # present working directory ls -l # list notebooks . %%script bash # Extract saved variables source /tmp/variables.sh echo &quot;Look for images in notebooks, print working directory, list files&quot; cd $notebooks/images # this should exist per fastpages pwd ls -l . Look inside a Markdown File . “cat” reads data from the file and gives its content as output . %%script bash # Extract saved variables source /tmp/variables.sh echo &quot;Navigate to project, then navigate to area wwhere files were cloned&quot; cd $project echo &quot;show the contents of README.md&quot; echo &quot;&quot; cat README.md # show contents of file, in this case markdown echo &quot;&quot; echo &quot;end of README.md&quot; . Env, Git and GitHub . Env(ironment) is used to capture things like path to Code or Home directory. Git and GitHub is NOT Only used to exchange code between individuals, it is often used to exchange code through servers, in our case deployment for Website. All tools we use have a behind the scenes relationships with the system they run on (MacOS, Windows, Linus) or a relationship with servers which they are connected to (ie GitHub). There is an “env” command in bash. There are environment files and setting files (.git/config) for Git. They both use a key/value concept. . “env” show setting for your shell | “git clone” sets up a director of files | “cd $project” allows user to move inside that directory of files | “.git” is a hidden directory that is used by git to establish relationship between machine and the git server on GitHub. | . %%script bash # This command has no dependencies echo &quot;Show the shell environment variables, key on left of equal value on right&quot; echo &quot;&quot; env . %%script bash # Extract saved variables source /tmp/variables.sh cd $project echo &quot;&quot; echo &quot;show the secrets of .git&quot; cd .git ls -l echo &quot;&quot; echo &quot;look at config file&quot; cat config . Advanced Student Request - Make a file in Bash . This example was requested by a student (Jun Lim, CSA). The request was to make jupyer file using bash, I adapted the request to markdown. This type of thought will have great extrapolation to coding and possibilities of using List, Arrays, or APIs to build user interfaces. JavaScript is a language where building HTML is very common. . To get more interesting output from terminal, this will require using something like mdless (https://github.com/ttscoff/mdless). This enables see markdown in rendered format. . On Desktop Install PKG from MacPorts | In Terminal on MacOS Install ncurses | gem install mdless | . | .

Bundle Install and Make Steps (All) . Commands are the same for all Machines, Terminals, and Projects. We are all building GitHub pages websites in similar fashion. . Open your terminal in VS Code through View -&gt; Terminal. Alternatively, the shortcut Ctrl + ` can be used. (Opening up VS Code’s terminal opens your student repository in the project directory.) . | Type bundle install This command installs the dependencies in your Gemfile. . | Type make This runs the local server. . | #### Apple only issue, &quot;markdown&quot; error #### ln -s /opt/homebrew/share/jupyter/nbconvert ~/Library/Jupyter . Go to the localhost link provided in the output: | Now, whenever the blog is edited in VS Code, the local website will show the changes upon refresh (you could run make convert to check and ensure Juptyer Notebooks are built and up to date). . Make commands (local build: make, make clean, make stop, make convert) . These commands are used to build and manage a localhost version of website. The purpose of this is to verify and test code changes prior to pushing changes to GitHub Pages. . make This runs the local server . | make clean stops the local server and cleans the files (recommended to use this to stop). This means you will be unable to access your blog on http://localhost until you run make again. . | make stop stops the local server. . | make convert converts Jupyter Notebook files, run this if your .ipynb files are not updating on the server. . | . . VSCode Commit changes to pdate public GitHub Pages (All) . The VSCode saved files are only stored on your computer locally until you commit/sync the changes. If you go to your actual blog on the web (https://.github.io/student), you will notice that the changes are not reflected there. To ensure that the public website updates, you will need to commit and sync your changes in VSCode; this will push changes to GitHub and activate a rebuild of the website. . Commit Changes, version control locally . This creates a version update in you local git database. Often developers commit several times before they sync/push. This allows lots of small changes that can be easily reviewed and rolled back. Review COMMITS in VSCode. . Click on the button that says “Source Control” in VS Code’s left sidebar . | Click on the plus sign to stage your changes . . | Enter a message for your commit in the message box. . | Click the “Commit button” . | Sync Chaanges, update change in GitHub . This moves commit(s) from local git database to GitHub. This will create an Action in GitHub pages and trigger an update to the website, if code is without errors. . Click the Menu button and then click “Push”. . . | . Creat a Github Pages custom domain (Delayed) . Do Not Continue . Stick with standard gihub.io domain. We will not be doing a custom domain at this time, but we will do this sometime during the year.. . Overview . This process is used to change github.io to a custom domain, aka nighthawkcodingsociety.com. . AWS Route 53 is a DNS service that provides routing to web applications. When you enter a URL in your web browser, the request is sent to a DNS resolver. In our customization, the resolver finds a Route 53 server that can translate the URL’s domain intoan IP address. The Route 53 server sends the information back to the resolver, who then sends it to the browser. The browser is able to access the webpage through the IP address it has received. . . In addition, you can use Route 53 to create a subdomain that maps a Custom Domain to your Github Pages blog. In the example below, the domain https://lily.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/ will point to https://lwu1822.github.io/student/. . . Steps . AWS . Go to AWS Route 53, and click on “Hosted zones”. . | Click on “Create record”. . . | Create a subdomain in “Record name”. Change the “Record type” to CNAME. CNAME creates an alias that maps one domain name to another domain. Finally, in the “Value” section, enter your Github URL in the form of: &lt;username&gt;.github.io. Be sure to omit the link to your repository (use &lt;username&gt;.github.io instead of &lt;username&gt;.github.io/student). . . | Click on “Create records”. Your record should look something like this: . . | Github Pages . Create a Github pages repository and click on “Settings”. . | In the sidebar, click on “Pages”. Under “Build and deployment”, ensure that the Github Pages is being built from the main branch. If you forked nighthawkcoders/student, you might need to specify that before you can move on to Step 3. . . | Enter the subdomain you configured in Hosted zones. . . Github pages will run a DNS check. Once the check is successful, access your Github pages with your new subdomain name (ex: lily.nighthawkcodingsociety.com). The subdomain should redirect to your Github Pages blog. . Troubleshooting: If the check is unsuccessful, check to see that you did the “AWS” steps properly. Also check to see if you spelled the subdomain correctly in Github Pages. If that does not work, delete the record in AWS and create it again. (It took me multiple times to get it to work, even though I typed the correct domain name. So if you encounter this error, you may have to be patient.) . | Click “Enforce HTTPS” so that the subdomain will be accessed over HTTPS. . | . BaseURL configuration . In _config.yml, change the line that says baseurl to: . baseurl: &quot;&quot; . This ensures that Github Pages is formatted correctly. This is because originally, the Github Pages site was under the subdirectory student (ex: lwu1822.github.io/student). After configuring a domain/subdomain, the baseurl would be “” since the URL would look like https://lily.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/ (no subdirectory). . As you edit this file you will observe the left panel of icons puts a help hint of ‘1’ on the Explorer icon. Later when you save (ctl-s or cmd-s) the help hint will move to the Source Control icon. You will need to commit this change and sync it to GitHub. . VSCode/Git Reference . . Troubleshooting DNS (dig) . dig is a Linux command that outputs DNS information, which can be used for troubleshooting. . Run dig &lt;your subdomain&gt; to check that the subdomain and the Github URL it points to is properly configured. . dig lily.nighthawkcodingsociety.com A ; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.16.1-Ubuntu &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; lily.nighthawkcodingsociety.com A ;; global options: +cmd ;; Got answer: ;; -&gt;&gt;HEADER&lt;&lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 14554 ;; flags: qr rd ad; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 5, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0 ;; WARNING: recursion requested but not available ;; QUESTION SECTION: ;lily.nighthawkcodingsociety.com.

            "content": "Hello, World! . This article shows the basic language structures and constructs of Java (aka anatomy). In async order, it is critical to understand these examples and learn vocab for OOP and Creating Objects: . Object Oriented Programming | Creating Objects | Calling Methods | . Static example . The class HelloStatic contains the classic “Hello, World!” message that is often used as an introduction to a programming language. The “public static void main(String[] args)”, or main method, is the default runtime method in Java and has a very specific and ordered definition (signature). . The key terms in HelloStatic introduction: . “class” is a blueprint for code, it is the code definition and must be called to run | “method” or “static method” in this case, is the code to be run/executed, similar to a procedure | “method definition” or “signature” are the keywords “public static void” in front of the name “main” and the parameters “String[] args” after the name. | “method call” is the means in which we run the defined code | . // Define Static Method within a Class public class HelloStatic { // Java standard runtime entry point public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(&quot;Hello World!&quot;); } } // A method call allows us to execute code that is wrapped in Class HelloStatic.main(null); // Class prefix allows reference of Static Method . Dynamic Example . This example starts to use Java in its natural manner, using an object within the main method. This example is a very basic illustration of Object Oriente Programming (OOP). The main method is now used as a driver/tester, by making an instance of the class. Thus, it creates an Object using the HelloObject() constructor. Also, this Class contains a getter method called getHello() which returns the value with the “String hello”. . The key terms in HelloStatic introduction: . “Object Oriented Programming” focuses software design around data, or objects. | “object” contains both methods and data | “instance of a class” is the process of making an object, unique or instances of variables are created within the object | “constructor” special method in class, code that is used to initialize the data within the object | “getter” is a method that is used to extract or reference data from within the object. | . // Define Class with Constructor returning Object public class HelloObject { private String hello; // instance attribute or variable public HelloObject() { // constructor hello = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;; } public String getHello() { // getter, returns value from inside the object return this.hello; // return String from object } public static void main(String[] args) { HelloObject ho = new HelloObject(); // Instance of Class (ho) is an Object via &quot;new HelloObject()&quot; System.out.println(ho.getHello()); // Object allows reference to public methods and data } } // IJava activation HelloObject.main(null); . Dynamic Example with two constructors . This last example adds to the basics of the Java anatomy. The Class now contains two constructors and a setter to go with the getter. Also, observe the driver/tester now contains two objects that are initialized differently, 0 and 1 argument constructor. Look at the usage of the “this” prefix. The “this” keyword helps in clarification between instance and local variable. . The key terms in HelloDynamic introduction: . “0 argument constructor” constructor method with no parameter () | “1 argument constructor” construct method with a parameter (String hello) | “this keyword” allows you to clear reference something that is part of the object, data or method | “local variable” is a variable that is passed to the method in this example, see the 1 argument constructor as it has a local variable “String hello” | “dynamic” versus “static” is something that has option to change, static never changes. A class (blueprint) and objects (instance of blueprint) are generally intended to be dynamic. Constructors and Setters are used to dynamically change the content of an object. | “Java OOP, Java Classes/Objects, Java Class Attributes, Java Class Methods, Java Constructors” are explained if more complete detail in W3 Schools: https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_oop.asp | . // Define Class public class HelloDynamic { // name the first letter of class as capitalized, note camel case // instance variable have access modifier (private is most common), data type, and name private String hello; // constructor signature 1, public and zero arguments, constructors do not have return type public HelloDynamic() { // 0 argument constructor this.setHello(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); // using setter with static string } // constructor signature, public and one argument public HelloDynamic(String hello) { // 1 argument constructor this.setHello(hello); // using setter with local variable passed into constructor } // setter/mutator, setter have void return type and a parameter public void setHello(String hello) { // setter this.hello = hello; // instance variable on the left, local variable on the right } // getter/accessor, getter used to return private instance variable (encapsulated), return type is String public String getHello() { // getter return this.hello; } // public static void main(String[] args) is signature for main/drivers/tester method // a driver/tester method is singular or called a class method, it is never part of an object public static void main(String[] args) { HelloDynamic hd1 = new HelloDynamic(); // no argument constructor HelloDynamic hd2 = new HelloDynamic(&quot;Hello, Nighthawk Coding Society!&quot;); // one argument constructor System.out.println(hd1.getHello()); // accessing getter System.out.println(hd2.getHello()); } } // IJava activation HelloDynamic.main(null); . Hacks . Build your own Jupyter Notebook meeting these College Board and CTE competencies. It is critical to understand Static versus Instance Now, this is College Board requirement!!! . Explain Anatomy of a Class in comments of program (Diagram key parts of the class). | Comment in code where there is a definition of a Class and an instance of a Class (ie object) | Comment in code where there are constructors and highlight the signature difference in the signature | Call an object method with parameter (ie setters). | . Additional requirements (Pick something) . Go through code progression of understanding Class usage and generating an Instance of a Class (Object). . a.

Cloud Computing Traditionally, classrooms have been serviced by on premise desktops; costs can be high, and the aging of machines can be rapid. The purpose of this project is to create workspaces, similar to laptops/desktops, but in the cloud. The students would use their District issued Chromebook to access these cloud workspaces, which would enable them to perform coding work in their Computer Science Pathway. The early cost number analysis has indicated that this could be much more affordable in a 5 year cycle, plus aging amd maintenace of equipment is now outsourced to the cloud provider. . Monthly Services/Breakdown . This shows total cost of about 2 machines per year. 10 months x $500 = $5000 . . Daily Usage .

Automation Planning . This automation plan set out to create cloud-based AWS EC2’s and provision them with Kasm workspaces. After many experiments with manual configurations, a recipe for servers and tools was created. The recipe was converted to Terraform plans and Kasm/Docker containers to produce cloud-desktops to meet Computer Science tools needs. . The automation process involves setting up AWS EC2 instances with Ubuntu Linux images and provisioning them with Kasm workspaces. A Kasm workspace, built on docker containers, provides an operating system, desktop environment, and software development tools for the Computer Science classroom students. . Automating Cloud Setups The following illustration assumes a Terraform recipe being pushed to each AWS EC2, the EC2 instances are provisioned with Ubuntu Linux images. The names Kasm1.ncs.com, Kasm2.ncs.com, ... represent cloud machines connected to a Kasm registry, the registry is a means of providing containerized desktop software. Each image + Kasm containerized software provides an operating system, desktop environment, and software development tools. . Diagram illustrating AWS EC2 instances with Kasm workspaces .

Terraform recipe The term recipe is used to describe all the elements needed to build the AWS EC2 Ubunto images. Terraform is the tool that drives the process, AWS CLI is tool chain that delivers the content. A Terraform recipe, as in a cooking recipe, has many steps, intermediate processes, and outcomes. These steps, processes, and outcomes are detailed and form the majority of the content in this document. . Kasm workspace In this context, the term workspace is used to describe the process of defining and delivering a computing environment that users can use to access a simulated desktop and development applications. Kasm registry is a distribution marketplace that works over HTTP. A workspace is defined by a Docker/DevOps engineer and is distributed as a Docker container, a workspace recipe, through the Kasm registry. A workpace adminstrator installs Kasm workspace on the Kasm instance. The installed Kasm workspace, after installation, can be run by a user to initiate a session on the AWS EC2 Ununtu Linux instance. . Scaling and Management To scale the number of students using the workspaces, each machine can have up to 5 user logins per instance (for free license), but based on resources consumed, it would adequately serve 3 active sessions. There are many additional Terraform, AWS and/or Kasm features to allocate resources, scale resources, and timeout inactive workspace sessions. Additionally, machines can be put to sleep, for instance 12am to 6am daily to save on cost;woken up based off of demand weekends and holidays. All the machines are on a AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), in this type of an environment Amazon has provided many additional tools and process to manage usage and control costs. . Setup Requirements (Part 1 - System Setup) . System setup These are features requirements that get the Kasm system running on AWS EC2 Ubuntu. The following specifications have been captured by a proof of concept analysis. Terraform is the selected tool for building recipes, AWS is the infrastructure, and GitHub will be used for version control. . AWS EC2 Instances . AWS instances are spread over 3 regions. By default, AWS only allows 5 public IP addresses per region. Because of this limitation, this inital configuration uses 3 regions to obtain 11 machines to server 33 simultaneous users. This limitation would be overcome by refactoring to multi-server Kasm configuration. . To set up the first 5 AWS EC2 instances, we will use the following specifications: . Region Oregon (us-west-2) | Instance t2.medium (2 x CPU, 4 Gib RAM) | Architecture x86 | Use “Kasm” key pair in Oregon VPC | Storage 60 Gib gp3 general purpose SD | Allow SSH, HTTP, HTTPS | . To setup next 4 AWS EC2 instance, we will use the same configuration with the following modifications. . Region N. Virginia (us-east-1) | Instance t2.medium (2 x CPU, 4 Gib RAM), but identier is specific to VPC | Use “Kasm” key pair in N. Viginia VPC | . To setup final 2 AWS EC2 instance, we will use the same configuration with the following modifications. Note, cost is slightly more expensive using California. . Region N.California (us-west-1) | Instance t2.medium (2 x CPU, 4 Gib RAM), but identier is specific to VPC | Use “Kasm” key pair in N.California VPC | . Pool of Kasm workspaces . Additionally, we will install Kasm version 1.13.1 using the provided scripting commands. We will have a pool of servers kasm10&lt;N&gt;, kasm20&lt;N&gt;, kasm30&lt;N&gt;. The pool of servers required is based of off the number of Users divided by 5. Each kasm instance will only support 5 users, 3 simulaneous access. . To perform proof of concept we will build kasm workspace (kasm100 to kasm104, kasm200 to kasm2003, kasm300 to kasm301). The kasm101` machine is used to test the features Kasm workspaces with the automated installs. . # Reference: https://Kasmweb.com/docs/latest/install/single_server_install.html cd /tmp curl -O https://Kasm-static-content.s3.amazonaws.com/Kasm_release_1.13.1.421524.tar.gz tar -xf Kasm_release_1.13.1.421524.tar.gz # Automate prompts for EULA, Swap Partition,and Port sudo bash Kasm_release/install.sh --accept-eula --swap-size 8192 -L 8443 . Setup Requirements (Part 2 - Networking) . Networking To enable user-friendly internet access, we will allocate AWS EC2 elastic IPs and set up DNS subdomains using AWS Route 53.

For Terraform automation the primary requirement is to add a registry to the default configuration that point to the Del Norte HS registry … . GitHub Registry location: https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/kasm_registry/1.0/ . Automation Terraform and AWS CLI . To manage the automation, we will install Terraform and AWS CLI. The AWS CLI will be configured with AWS credentials, and we will verify access to AWS services using sts, s3, and s3api commands. . Tool installation and verification. This is a preparation step prior to using Terraform. Below are commands to configure Amazon Web Service Command Line Interface awscli, verify configuration sts, and test the Simple Storage Service s3 and s3api. . Terraform is a tool that lets you build, change, and version cloud resources safely and efficiently. | AWS CLI (Amazon Web Service Command Line Interface) is a tool to manage your AWS services. | .

Create a folder for your test (e.g., stage1). . Place your variable.tf and main.tf files in the folder. | Run terraform init to initialize the project. | Run terraform plan to see what resources will be created. | If the plan looks good, run terraform apply to create the EC2 instances. | Manually check the AWS Management Console to ensure that the EC2 instances are created with the correct tags and elastice IPs. | Terraform provides the terraform destroy command, which you can use to destroy all the resources created by a specific Terraform configuration. Run this before moving on to next test. | Check that created EC2’s and Elastic IPs are gone. | . 2nd Stage - EC2 Instances and Route 53 Records: . Create a new folder for this test (e.g., stage2). . Run terraform init in this folder. | Run terraform plan to see what resources will be created. | If the plan looks good, run terraform apply to create the Route 53 records. | Manually check the AWS Management Console to ensure that the Route 53 records are created correctly. | Run terraform destroy | Check that created EC2’s and Elastic IPs are gone. | . 3rd Stage - EC2 Instances, Route 53 Records, and Nginx Configurations: .

Student database . Teacher has a student SQLite database running under Python with GitHub pages frontend. A Python backend is preferred, over Java, as AWS CLI has a Python BOTO module. Conversion from SQLite to RDS is trivial after RDS setup is established. . This database with a little modification to SQL schema and Python code, could support maintaining a list of users, APIs and calling Kasm developer APIs. The Python database currently supports standard CRUD operations that seem to map well to Kasm developer API. The frontend is managed under GitHub pages, which complies with Themes and their SASS CSS definitions. . APIs will be added to support requests and responses requirements of the Kasm API.

Nighthawkcoders DevOps GitHub . Kasm workspace Architecture: . Kasm uses Docker to build workspaces and a GitHub registry to store and manage workspaces. Kasm workspaces start from a GitHub template, the template repository is infused with GitHub Pages actions. These actions build a user-friendly display of the constructed workspaces in the registry. Here are some key links to start on the journey of building workspaces within the registry. The SDLC consist of building Docker and support files, publishing to the registry, installing through the Kasm adminstrative interface on the EC2 instance, and then loading/testing on the Kasm desktop. . Kasm workspace video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGP69_f1wq0 | Kasm Registries video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6ggn9McIwI | Be aware that Kasm system, Docker Workpaces must match versions (1.13.1) | Default Kasm registry link: https://registry.Kasmweb.com/ | . Kasm requires a Registory for workspaces: . A Del Norte HS Computer Science Registry in Github has been created. Multiple locations and references in the repository are important to understand the different aspects of the registry. The Del Norte HS Computer Science Registry and its Kasm workspaces need to be developed to meet the needs of CSSE, CSP, and CSA classes. However, this work can be done asynchronously to the Terraform automation plan. . Registry link: https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/Kasm_registry/. This link is placed into adminstrative workspaces on the Kasm1 to KasmN machines. Deployment can occur directly from a GitHub commit straight into the registered workspace, across many machines at once. Branching or Forking should be employed to avoid accidental deployments. But, the feature are in the system for success. As a strategy, a forked repo/registry could be used to manage test, then a pull request after testing could trigger production repo/registry update. | Registry Config file. This is setup correctly for this projects purposes, but you should be aware that it is required for GitHub Pages. If registry is changed to nighthawkcodingsocity.com subdomain, then this file will need to be revised. | GitHub for Registry. This contains the README for valuable information on setup and development. A Kasm workspace/docker developer would spend time here customizing code to support user requirements. Version Control for Docker workspaces is built into the Kasm registry and requirements should be learned from their materials and experience. | GitHub Pages for Registry. This is a pretty view of the workspaces in the registry. The Kasm workspace registry is professionally designed, it has versions built into the URLs. By cursory review you could maintain 1.0 and 1.1 workspaces at the same time, to allow soft transitions to updates. GitHub Task collaboration was placed into each workspace allow adminstrators and users to add issues directly into GitHub. Tracking changes, and managing containerized desktops is built into the Kasm tools. | . Kasm workspaces Docker layout . This below Docker file follows the Kasm format with the required head and tail sections; all customizations must be done in between. This shows setup starters for some of our required tools. . Chrome is added in this script. This was not included in bash script but is essential to GitHub Pages code-build-test-debug development lifecycle. | VSCode is shown below. In this example it is sourcing a directory installed by the Kasm image. Customizing our Kasm image can make installation process much easier. | Anaconda is show below. In this example you can see similarities in installation as compared to the script above. Of course, we should switch our implementation to Miniconda to save space and avoid large GUI application which could impact our memory footprint. As with VSCode, we could fully manage a version of this package within our Kasm image to minimize Docker complexities. | .

Let’s create a histogram to visualize the distribution of formation energies per atom. . import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Assuming you have a pandas DataFrame named &#39;mp_database&#39; with the &#39;formation_energies_per_atom&#39; column # Calculate the average and standard deviation average_energy = mp_database[&#39;formation_energy_per_atom&#39;].mean() std_deviation = mp_database[&#39;formation_energy_per_atom&#39;].std() # Plot the distribution of the column plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6)) plt.hist(mp_database[&#39;formation_energy_per_atom&#39;], bins=30, edgecolor=&#39;black&#39;, alpha=0.7) # Add labels and title to the plot plt.xlabel(&#39;Formation Energies per Atom&#39;) plt.ylabel(&#39;Frequency&#39;) plt.title(&#39;Distribution of Formation Energies per Atom&#39;) # Annotate the plot with average and standard deviation plt.axvline(average_energy, color=&#39;red&#39;, linestyle=&#39;dashed&#39;, linewidth=2, label=&#39;Average&#39;) plt.axvline(average_energy + std_deviation, color=&#39;orange&#39;, linestyle=&#39;dashed&#39;, linewidth=2, label=&#39;Standard Deviation&#39;) plt.axvline(average_energy - std_deviation, color=&#39;orange&#39;, linestyle=&#39;dashed&#39;, linewidth=2) plt.annotate(f&#39;Average: {average_energy:.2f}&#39;, xy=(average_energy, 300), xytext=(average_energy + 0.5, 400), arrowprops=dict(facecolor=&#39;black&#39;, shrink=0.05), fontsize=12) plt.annotate(f&#39;Standard Deviation: {std_deviation:.2f}&#39;, xy=(average_energy + std_deviation, 250), xytext=(average_energy + std_deviation + 1, 350), arrowprops=dict(facecolor=&#39;black&#39;, shrink=0.05), fontsize=12) # Show legend plt.legend() # Display the plot plt.show() . . ##Step 6: Filtering and Preparing Data for Analysis Next, we’ll filter the data to keep only the most relevant materials. We’ll sort the data based on formation energy and remove duplicate formulas to keep only the materials with the lowest formation energy for each formula. . orig_data = pd.read_csv(&quot;data2022.csv&quot;, na_filter=False) . len(orig_data) . 681 . orig_data .

min_properties.drop(&quot;composition_dict&quot;, axis=1) min_properties = min_properties.drop(&quot;formula&quot;, axis=1) . Step 8: Combining Property Data . Next, we’ll combine the composition-averaged, maximum, and minimum property DataFrames (‘average_properties’, ‘max_properties’, and ‘min_properties’) into a single design matrix DataFrame named ‘design_matrix’. . design_matrix = pd.concat([average_properties, max_properties, min_properties], axis=1) . Step 9: Splitting Data for Machine Learning . To train and evaluate our machine learning model, we need to split the data into training and testing sets. . targets = filtered_data[[&quot;band_gap&quot;, &quot;formation_energy_per_atom&quot;]] targets.index = filtered_data.formula . targets . band_gap formation_energy_per_atom . formula .

Normalization is an essential preprocessing step in machine learning. We’ll normalize the training data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. . # Set of commands to obtain the mean and standard deviation of train_X train_mean = train_X.mean() train_std = train_X.std() # Set of commands to obtain the new normalized train and test data sets norm_train_X = (train_X - train_mean) / (train_std) norm_test_X = (test_X - train_mean) / (train_std) . Step 11: Cross-Validated Linear Regression . We’ll perform linear regression using scikit-learn and apply cross-validation to evaluate the model’s performance. . # Set of commands to run the 5-fold cross-validation on the training set, pick the best-scoring model, and apply it to the test set kfold = KFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42) mlr = linear_model.LinearRegression() mlr.fit(train_X, train_y[&quot;formation_energy_per_atom&quot;]) cross_val = cross_validate(mlr, train_X, train_y[&quot;formation_energy_per_atom&quot;], cv=kfold, return_estimator=True) cv_mlr = cross_val[&quot;estimator&quot;][np.argmax(cross_val[&quot;test_score&quot;])] cv_mlr.fit(test_X, test_y[&quot;formation_energy_per_atom&quot;]) yhat = cv_mlr.predict(test_X) # Set of commands to obtain the RMSE and MAE MAE = mean_absolute_error(test_y[&quot;formation_energy_per_atom&quot;], yhat) RMSE = mean_squared_error(test_y[&quot;formation_energy_per_atom&quot;], yhat, squared=False) print(&quot;The mean absolute error for this cross-validated linear model is &quot; + str(MAE)) print(&quot;The root mean squared error for this cross-validated linear model is &quot; + str(RMSE)) . The mean absolute error for this cross-validated linear model is 0.028795650045063535 The root mean squared error for this cross-validated linear model is 0.03491365888584181 . Step 12: Data Visualization - Pairplot . Finally, we’ll use seaborn to create a pairplot to visualize the relationships between different element properties. . features = [c for c in element_data.columns] grid = sns.pairplot(element_data[features]) . . train_y . band_gap formation_energy_per_atom . formula .

            "content": "Reflection: | . My team did not qualify for N@TM due to many issues that were not resolved in time. a few included our Cors Issue which is now resolved. As a team we struggled with communication and work management. In the end before N@TM, we were able to created a working frontend and backend. this allowed our features to work without a connection to the primary objective of this project. This overall still allowed us to create working features like games that have features within themselves. . Grow: | . To my CPT project I will finishing the adding of an additional feature of a meme generator which would allow players to input their own memes and generate memes. This would allow interaction with the database to update the database with new memes. After receiving much needed feedback, we learned that we needed to connect better to databases after that was what were were taught through the team teaches. Now, we are working on a more educational, diverse and deep project which could possibly allow us to score very high in the College board exam. I also feel like i wasn’t involved enough to the project at all and plan on bringing back what i need to do to help the team. I haven’t been asking questions or putting enough effort on this project yet. . Glow: | . A few things included minimal arguing and fights which let us work better. We were able to get feedback and learn what our mistakes were by talking more to Mr. Mortensen. And lastly I was able to grow closer to my teammates who i didn’t know very well before. . Something I saw that I liked in compsci: | . While coming up with the project, I looked at other groups work in other period and my own. A few examples includes Tarun T and Imaad M’s group whose project was intricate as it worked well socially as it used humor and day to day games. Another example was Aditiya D, Hanlun L, Trevor H, Mathew W, and Lakshanya S’s group. They worked very closly with API’s to integrate a sort of cookbook that could help users. . Something i saw that i liked outside of compsci: | . While I wasn’t at N@TM, i have friends in other CTE classes who have showed me their work. One of whom was Joshan T. He is in the Ceramics class where they work with clay to do pottery. He showed me how there were many different techniques to get the same objective done. He showed me how there was different hand techniques that were used to create pot lips and other techniques to heighten the clay for molding. .",
