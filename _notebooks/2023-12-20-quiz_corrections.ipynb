    "# Problem 10\n",
    "The correct answer was B not C because regular guided tour tickets are erroneously set to 8, when they should be adjusted to 10, aligning with the correct quantity. Similarly, regular general admission tickets and child guided tour tickets are incorrectly set to 6 when they should be modified to 8, reflecting the accurate values for these ticket types. Rectifying these values not only ensures consistency but also brings the calculations in line with the intended ticket pricing structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Problem 15\n",
    "The correct answer was A not C because the discrepancy arises from the distinct initializations of variable i in the two programs. Program A prints i and then increments it, while program B increments i and then prints it. Addressing this inconsistency requires adjusting the loop structure to ensure that both programs handle the variable i in a consistent manner, ultimately leading to the correct output.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Problem 16\n",
    "The correct answer was D not A because the deviation occurs in the incorrect incrementation of the index. Contrary to the original code where the index is incremented, the correction involves decrementing the index. Placing this decrement between lines 7 and 8 ensures that all elements are correctly checked, aligning the loop with its intended functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Problem 27\n",
    "The correct answer was D not C because the misconception lies in the belief that problems solvable computationally are dependent on an internet connection. The correction involves recognizing that problems that can be solved computationally do not necessarily require an internet connection. Understanding this distinction is crucial for accurately selecting the appropriate choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Problem 28\n",
    "The correct answer was B not D because the issue stems from both variables being erroneously assigned the initial value of alpha. To rectify this, the correction involves assigning distinct variables their respective values, ensuring that the program operates as intended and produces the correct results.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Problem 29\n",
    "The correct answer was A not C because the misunderstanding lies in the assumption that removing a file's metadata allows for the reconstruction of the original data. Clarifying this concept reveals that removing metadata does not facilitate the reconstruction of the original data. Recognizing this limitation is essential for a more precise evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Problem 34\n",
    "The correct answer was C not A because the mistake is in the third call to BotMover, where the robot attempts to move forward off the edge of the grid. The correction involves ensuring that the robot's movement stays within the defined grid boundaries, preventing unintended consequences and ensuring the correct execution of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Problem 50\n",
    "The correct answer was D not B because the misconception lies in the belief that Algorithm I and II worked in a reasonable time but Algorithm III did not. Acknowledging that all three algorithms worked efficiently is crucial for the accurate evaluation of their performance, leading to the correct choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Problem 56\n",
    "The correct answer was A not D because the discrepancy arises from the incorrect assumption that version II takes less time than version I. Recognizing that version II actually takes longer than version I is crucial for the accurate assessment of their relative efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Problem 58\n",
    "The correct answer was C not A because the misunderstanding stems from the false evaluation of the expression y = z. Recognizing that this expression evaluates to false ensures that the intended result of false is returned, aligning with the correct interpretation of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Problem 59\n",
    "The correct answer was C not D because the misconception lies in the assumption that open-source software can be continually updated by the original developers. Clarifying this concept reveals that open-source software can be updated by the public even without the involvement of the original developers. Understanding this nature is essential for a more accurate understanding of open-source development.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Problem 60\n",
    "The correct answer was D not A because the error occurs in the third line of code, where count is incorrectly assigned as the length of bothList (12) minus the length of bothList (7). Correcting this calculation to determine the correct length ensures that the program produces the intended result and avoids the incorrect outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Problem 62\n",
    "The correct answer was A and B not D because the misconception arises from the false evaluation of x AND y, which leads to the body of the IF statement not being executed. Understanding the logic of the AND operation ensures the correct interpretation of the code and accurate control flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Problem 63\n",
    "The correct answer was A and B not A and D because the misunderstanding lies in the incorrect assessment of how the total amount of money for selling all copies of a book is calculated. The correction involves recognizing that the quantity available for each book is multiplied by its selling price, leading to the accurate calculation of the total amount of money received.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Problem 64\n",
    "The correct answer was B & D not C because the mistake is in the repeated addition of -2 to the result five times, resulting in the intended product of -10. Understanding the correct application of the procedure ensures that the program produces the intended product instead of an unintended one.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Problem 65\n",
    "The correct answer was B & C not A & D because the misconception lies in the assumption that the code concatenates substrings \"lope\" and \"jacka\" in a different way. Recognizing that the code correctly concatenates these substrings and stores the result as \"lopejacka\" in the variable 'animal' ensures the accurate interpretation of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Problem 66\n",
    "The correct answer was A & C not B & D because the misunderstanding arises from the incorrect incrementation of the variable count and the placement of currentNum inside the loop. The correction involves incrementing count within the body of the IF statement when currentNum is a perfect number and ensuring that currentNum is incremented inside the loop but outside the body of the IF statement. These adjustments ensure the correct counting of perfect numbers within the specified range.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Problem 67\n",
    "The correct answer was A&B and not C because the chosen code accurately produces the intended output, contrary to the assumption of unintended output. Recognizing the correct code for the intended output is crucial for the accurate interpretation of the program and selecting the correct option.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Reflection\n",
    "While I am not entirely satisfied with my score of 49 out of 67, I view it as an opportunity for personal development. Analyzing my mistakes will enable me to concentrate on areas where I face challenges and enhance my understanding. To review and reinforce my knowledge, I plan to revisit team lectures and watch instructional YouTube videos explaining the intricacies of each topic and what is expected by College Board. Despite my reservations about the score, I believe I have gained valuable insights and knowledge, contributing to my overall progress and growth throughout this trimester and in this specific class. Having a new team gives me optimism, as I anticipate receiving support from my teammates to address and improve upon my weaknesses in the course."
