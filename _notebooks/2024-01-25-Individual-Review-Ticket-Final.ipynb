    "# Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project centers on something that all members of our group enjoy: video games and fun. Video games are a shared interest among us and something we regularly enjoy playing. Despite our love for gaming, we recognize the importance of moderation in gaming habits, which is why we developed this project. Our focus is on integrating gaming alongside educational, physical, and meme content hubs for easy access, aiming to motivate users to have fun while learning. Additionally, we've incorporated memes as another source of entertainment, offering an amusing way to engage with current events. Our project includes features designed to promote physical health, aid in studying, assess educational levels, and, importantly, allow users to unwind and enjoy themselves."
